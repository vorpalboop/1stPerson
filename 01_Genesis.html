</DIV>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT SIZE=7 STYLE="font-size: 32pt"><B>The
Book of Genesis</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Genesis 1 &ndash;
When I spoke, worlds were born</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the beginning, I brought the
heavens and the earth into existence.<BR>Before shape or structure,
the earth lay in emptiness&mdash;formless, shrouded in deep darkness,
covered by waters. My Spirit moved over the face of those waters,
attentive and intentional.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I willed light into being.<BR>I said
in My heart,<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo;</FONT>
and light burst forth. I perceived that the light was good, fitting
My purpose. I distinguished the light from the darkness and set them
apart. I called the light <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;day,</FONT>&rdquo;
and the darkness I called <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;night.&rdquo;</FONT>
Evening faded into morning: this was the first day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I determined to place a vast
expanse in the midst of the waters, to divide waters from waters.<BR>I
formed a great open space, stretching above the world. I separated
the waters below from the waters above the expanse, and it stood as I
intended. I named this expanse<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> &ldquo;sky.&rdquo;</FONT>
Evening passed into morning: the second day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Next, I gathered the waters under
the sky into regions, so that dry ground would appear.<BR>The dry
land arose where I directed it, and the waters collected where I set
their boundaries. I called the dry ground <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;earth,&rdquo;</FONT>
and the gathered waters I called <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;seas.&rdquo;</FONT>
I saw that this was good.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I then summoned the earth to bring
forth growth:<BR>Green plants, grasses that spread by seed, and
fruit-bearing trees, each kind containing its own seed within itself,
so life would continue according to its own pattern. The earth
answered My command, sending up plants and trees of many kinds, each
reproducing in its own way. I observed that this was good.<BR>Evening
passed into morning: the third day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I then set in place lights within
the sky to mark times and rhythms.<BR>I appointed them to divide day
from night, and to serve as signs for seasons, days, and years, to
give light upon the earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I made two great lights:<BR>The
greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the
night. I also set countless stars in their places. I fixed them in
the sky to shine on the earth, to rule over day and night, and to
distinguish light from darkness. I saw that this too was
good.<BR>Evening passed into morning: the fourth day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I turned to the waters and the
sky.<BR>I willed the waters to swarm with living creatures, great and
small, and I called forth birds to fly above the earth through the
open sky. I brought into being the great sea creatures and every
living thing that moves in the waters, each according to its kind,
and every winged bird according to its kind. I looked on all of them
and saw that it was good.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I blessed them, saying within My
will that they should be fruitful and multiply:<BR>The waters to be
filled with living creatures, and the birds to be many upon the earth
and across the sky.<BR>Evening passed into morning: the fifth day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I called forth living beings
upon the land.<BR>I brought into existence the livestock that dwell
near humankind, the creatures that crawl and creep close to the
ground, and the wild animals that roam the earth&mdash;each according
to its own kind and nature. It was as I intended, and I saw that it
was good.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After this, I purposed to make a
creature in a unique way.<BR>I said within Myself: <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">I
will make humankind in My image, reflecting My likeness, so they may
exercise care and rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the
sky, the livestock, all the earth, and every creature that moves on
the ground.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I created humanity in My own
image.<BR>In My image I formed them: male and female I made them. I
blessed them and charged them to be fruitful and multiply, to fill
the earth and wisely rule it; to steward the fish of the sea, the
birds of the air, and every living thing that moves on the earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I gave them provision, saying:<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">I
have given you every plant that bears seed on the face of the earth,
and every tree with fruit that has seed within it, to be your food.
And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to
every creature that moves on the ground&mdash;everything that has the
breath of life in it&mdash;I have given every green plant for food.</FONT>
And it was so.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I then gazed upon all that I had
made.<BR>From the highest star to the smallest seed, from the depths
of the sea to the heart of humankind, everything stood in its proper
place and purpose. I saw that it was very good.<BR>Evening passed
into morning: the sixth day.</P>
<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Genesis 2 &ndash; The
Garden, The Breath and The First Embrace </B></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">By the time the heavens and the
earth were finished, along with all their vast array, My work of
shaping them was complete. On the seventh day, I ceased from all the
work I had done. I rested&mdash;not from weariness, but to set apart
this day as a sign of completion and delight. I blessed the seventh
day and made it holy, because on that day I stopped from all My
creating and forming.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This is how I brought into being the
heavens and the earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before any plant of the field had
sprung up on the land, before cultivated crops were growing, I had
not yet sent rain on the earth, and there was no human being to till
and tend the soil. A mist would rise from the earth and water the
whole face of the ground, sustaining it in a quiet, hidden way.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I shaped the first human.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I formed the man from the dust of
the ground with care and intention, and I breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life. My own life-breath entered him, and the man
became a living being&mdash;aware, responsive, able to know Me and to
choose.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I then planted a garden in a place
called Eden, in the east, a place of beauty and abundance. There I
put the man I had formed, giving him a home. I caused to grow from
the ground every kind of tree that is pleasant to look at and good
for food. In the middle of the garden I placed two special trees: the
tree of life, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Eden, I sent out a river to
water the garden, and from there it divided and became four
headwaters. One I called Pishon; it encircled the whole land of
Havilah, where gold is found, and the gold of that land is good;
there are also aromatic resin and onyx stone there. The second river
I called Gihon; it flows around the land of Cush. The third is the
Tigris, flowing east of Assyria, and the fourth is the Euphrates. I
set these rivers as markers and lifelines, shaping the lands that
would come.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I took the man and settled him in
the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it&mdash;to cultivate and
guard what I had entrusted to him. I commanded him, granting wide
freedom with one clear boundary. I said, &ldquo;<FONT COLOR="#cc0000">From
every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil you must not eat, for on the day you eat
from it, you will surely die.&rdquo;</FONT> I spoke this so that
trust, obedience, and life would be bound together.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As I observed the man, I declared
within Myself:<FONT COLOR="#cc0000"> It is not good for the man to be
alone</FONT>. I had made much that was good, but this remained
incomplete. I resolved to make a helper corresponding to him&mdash;one
who would stand beside him, equal in worth, fitting him and
completing what was lacking in his solitude.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I formed out of the ground every
beast of the field and every bird of the sky and brought them to the
man to see what he would call them. Whatever he called each living
creature, that became its name. The man gave names to the livestock,
to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field. Yet among
all these creatures there was no helper found that corresponded to
him&mdash;none that matched him in nature, spirit, and fellowship.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I caused a deep sleep to fall on
the man, and while he slept, I took one of his sides&mdash;bone and
flesh&mdash;and then closed up the place with flesh again. From the
part taken from the man, I fashioned a woman and brought her to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man recognized her as his
counterpart and said in his heart:<BR>&ldquo;She is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh;<BR>she shall be called &lsquo;woman,&rsquo;<BR>for
she was taken out of man.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In this I established a pattern for
all generations: <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">a man will leave his father
and mother and be joined to his wife, and they will become one
flesh&mdash;a united life, a shared body and heart.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man and his wife were both
naked, yet they felt no shame. They stood before Me and before each
other without hiding, in complete innocence and trust, at peace with
themselves, with one another, and with Me.</P>
<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Genesis 3 &ndash; The
Serpent, The Fruit, And The Broken World </B></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The serpent I had made was more
shrewd than any of the wild animals of the field. He turned his
cunning toward the woman, twisting what I had said.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He asked her, &ldquo;Did God really
say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?&rdquo;<BR>The woman
answered him, repeating what she understood of My command: that they
could eat from the trees of the garden, but that the tree in the
middle of the garden was forbidden to them, and that if they ate from
it, they would die.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The serpent contradicted My word. He
told her, &ldquo;You will not surely die. God knows that when you eat
of it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil.&rdquo;<BR>He spoke half-truths to plant distrust in
her heart.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The woman looked at the tree and
weighed the serpent&rsquo;s words.<BR>She saw that the tree seemed
good for food, beautiful to the eyes, and desirable for gaining
wisdom. She trusted her own judgment and the serpent&rsquo;s lie
above My command. She took of its fruit and ate. She also gave some
to her husband, who was with her, and he ate as well.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At once, their eyes were
opened.<BR>They did gain a kind of knowledge, but it came with shame
and fear. They realized they were naked and exposed. Where there had
been innocence, there was now self-consciousness. They sewed fig
leaves together and made coverings for themselves, trying to hide
what they now felt was uncovered and vulnerable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the cool of the day, I came to
the garden in a way they had known and welcomed before.<BR>They heard
My presence moving among the trees, and instead of running toward Me,
they hid themselves among the trees of the garden. Sin had already
begun to bend their hearts away from Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I called to the man: <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Where
are you?&rdquo;</FONT><BR>I did not ask because I lacked knowledge,
but to draw him out, to lead him to confession.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He answered that he had heard Me and
was afraid because he was naked, so he hid.<BR>I said to him, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Who
told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree I
commanded you not to eat from?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man shifted the blame instead of
owning his choice.<BR>He said, &ldquo;The woman whom You gave to be
with me&mdash;she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate.&rdquo;<BR>In
his fear, he turned against both the gift I had given and the One who
had given it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I then said to the woman, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;What
is this you have done?&rdquo;</FONT><BR>She answered, &ldquo;The
serpent deceived me, and I ate.&rdquo;<BR>She spoke truth about being
deceived, yet she too had chosen to trust that voice above Mine.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I pronounced judgment, beginning
with the serpent who had led them astray.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To the serpent I said:<BR><FONT COLOR="#990000">&ldquo;Because
you have done this,<BR>you are cursed more than all c</FONT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">attle</FONT><FONT COLOR="#990000"><BR>and
more than every beast of the field.<BR>You will go on your belly<BR>and
eat dust all the days of your life.<BR>I will put hostility between
you and the woman,<BR>between your offspring and hers;<BR>he will
crush your head,<BR>and you will strike his heel.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In this, I set in motion both
judgment and a promise: there would one day come a descendant who
would deal a final blow to the deceiver.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To the woman I said:<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will greatly increase your pain in childbearing;<BR>in pain you will
bring forth children.<BR>Your desire will be for your husband,<BR>and
he will rule over you.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">What had been pure harmony would now
be touched by struggle, pain, and misalignment in the most intimate
human relationship.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To the man I said:<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Because
you listened to your wife<BR>and ate from the tree<BR>about which I
commanded you,<BR>&lsquo;You must not eat from it,&rsquo;<BR>cursed
is the ground because of you;<BR>through toil and hardship you will
eat of it<BR>all the days of your life.<BR>It will produce thorns and
thistles for you,<BR>and you will eat the plants of the field.<BR>By
the sweat of your face you will eat your bread<BR>until you return to
the ground,<BR>for out of it you were taken;<BR>for dust you are,<BR>and
to dust you will return.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man, carrying the weight of this
new reality, named his wife Eve, for he understood that she would be
the mother of all living.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Even in judgment, I showed care.<BR>I
made garments of skin for the man and for his wife and clothed them.
Their own fig-leaf coverings were fragile and temporary; I gave them
more durable clothing, a sign that I would still provide for them,
even outside the garden.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I said within My counsel:<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">The
man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. Now, he must
not be allowed to reach out his hand, take from the tree of life, and
eat, and live forever.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&rdquo;</FONT><BR>In
their fallen state, an endless life of corruption and separation from
Me would be a deeper misery, not a gift.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I drove the man out of the garden
of Eden, to work the ground from which he had been taken. I placed
cherubim on the east side of the garden and a flaming sword that
turned in every direction, guarding the way to the tree of life.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The garden was closed to them, but
My purpose for them was not ended. Even as they stepped into a world
of toil, pain, and death, I already held in My heart the plan to
restore what had been broken.</P>

In The Field And The Song Of Revenge </B></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Adam and Eve came together, and I
granted conception. She bore a son and named him Cain, saying that
with My help she had brought forth a man. Later she bore his brother
and named him Abel.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abel chose to care for flocks, and
Cain chose to work the soil. In the course of time they both brought
offerings to Me. Cain brought some of the produce of the ground. Abel
brought the firstborn from his flock, with the best portions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I regarded Abel and his offering
with favor. I did not look on Cain and his offering in the same way.
I saw the heart behind what each one brought&mdash;the trust, the
humility, the honor they gave Me, and the lack of it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Cain became very angry, and his face
fell. His anger was not only at his brother, but at Me, though he
would not admit it.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I spoke to Cain:<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Why
are you angry, and why has your face fallen?<BR>If you do what is
right, will you not be accepted?<BR>But if you do not do what is
right, sin is crouching at your door;<BR>it desires to master
you,<BR>but you must rule over it.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I warned him, for I saw the storm
forming inside him. Yet he did not turn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Cain spoke with Abel his brother.
Then, when they were out in the field together, Cain rose up against
Abel and killed him. The first human blood was spilled on the earth I
had made good.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to Cain, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Where
is Abel your brother?&rdquo;</FONT><BR>I knew what had happened, but
I called him to answer for it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He replied, &ldquo;I do not know. Am
I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo;<BR>With these words he tried to
hide what could not be hidden and denied the care he owed his own
brother.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;What
have you done?<BR>The voice of your brother&rsquo;s blood is crying
out to Me from the ground.<BR>Now you are cursed from the very
ground<BR>which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&rsquo;s
blood from your hand.<BR>When you work the soil, it will no longer
yield its strength for you.<BR>You will be a fugitive and a wanderer
on the earth.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Cain answered Me, &ldquo;My
punishment is more than I can bear. Today You drive me from the
ground, and I will be hidden from Your face. I will be a restless
wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Even in judgment, I held back
destruction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Not
so. If anyone kills Cain,<BR>vengeance will be taken on him
sevenfold.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I placed a sign upon Cain so that no
one who found him would kill him. Then Cain went out from before My
presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden&mdash;a
restless man in a restless land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Cain took a wife, and she conceived
and bore a son, Enoch. Cain began to build a city and named it after
his son Enoch. Human hands, that had shed a brother&rsquo;s blood,
now gathered stones and wood to build walls and dwellings.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Enoch&rsquo;s line came Irad;
from Irad, Mehujael; from Mehujael, Methushael; from Methushael,
Lamech. Life continued, even under the shadow of sin.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lamech took two wives; polygamy,
which I had not ordained, now appeared among them. The name of one
wife was Adah, and the other Zillah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Adah bore Jabal; he became the
ancestor of those who live in tents and keep livestock, spreading out
across the lands, roaming with their herds. His brother&rsquo;s name
was Jubal; he became the ancestor of all who play the harp and
flute&mdash;music and artistry rising from a fallen race.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who became a
craftsman in bronze and iron, shaping metal with skill. His sister&rsquo;s
name was Naamah. Culture, technology, and beauty grew side by side
with violence and pride.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lamech spoke to his wives and
boasted of violence:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Adah and Zillah, hear my
voice;<BR>you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say:<BR>I have killed
a man for wounding me,<BR>a young man for striking me.<BR>If Cain is
avenged sevenfold,<BR>then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">What I had spoken as a restraint
Lamech twisted into a song of arrogance and revenge. The line of Cain
showed both creativity and corruption: cities, music, tools, and also
pride, bloodshed, and distortion of My design.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Meanwhile, Adam again knew his wife,
and I gave them another son. She bore him and named him Seth, saying,
&ldquo;God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel,
whom Cain killed.&rdquo; Through this line I was preparing a
different path, a line through which My redemptive purpose would
move.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Seth in time had a son, and he was
named Enosh. Then, in those days, people began to call on My name
openly&mdash;to worship, to seek Me, to cry out to Me in a world
already marked by death and violence. Amid sin&rsquo;s spread, a line
of prayer and calling upon Me began to form, a small but real stream
of faith running through the growing human family.</P>

life in all was eight hundred and ninety-five years, and then he
died.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jared lived one hundred and
sixty-two years and became the father of Enoch. After the birth of
Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years and had other sons and
daughters. All the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two
years, and then he died.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Enoch lived sixty-five years and
became the father of Methuselah. After Methuselah&rsquo;s birth,
Enoch walked with Me in close fellowship for three hundred years, and
he had other sons and daughters. The total of his years was three
hundred and sixty-five. Enoch walked with Me, and then he was no
longer there, for I took him to Myself. He did not see death as the
others did; I drew him out of the stream of mortality.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Methuselah lived one hundred and
eighty-seven years and became the father of Lamech. After Lamech was
born, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years and had
other sons and daughters. All his days were nine hundred and
sixty-nine years, and then he died.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lamech lived one hundred and
eighty-two years and had a son. He named him Noah, saying from his
troubled heart, &ldquo;This one will comfort us in our work and in
the painful toil of our hands, because of the ground that the LORD
has cursed.&rdquo; He felt the weight of the curse on the soil and
dimly sensed that I would work some relief through this child. After
Noah&rsquo;s birth, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years
and had other sons and daughters. All the days of Lamech were seven
hundred and seventy-seven years, and then he died.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah was five hundred years old when
he became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Through
them, as I already knew from the beginning, the story of the earth
and its peoples would pass into a new chapter.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Genesis 6 &ndash;
Corruption, An Ark, And My Sorrowing Heart </B></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When human beings began to multiply
on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them, I watched
as something dark unfolded among them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Heavenly beings whom I had
made&mdash;&ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;&mdash;looked on the daughters of
humankind and saw that they were beautiful. They took wives for
themselves from among them, choosing whomever they desired, without
regard for My will or order.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said within Myself:<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;My
Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are flesh,
frail and bent toward corruption. Their days will be limited to one
hundred and twenty years.&rdquo;</FONT><BR>In this, I set a boundary
on their lifespans, placing a restraint on the spread of evil.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In those days, and also afterward,
there were mighty ones on the earth&mdash;men of great strength and
reputation&mdash;born when the sons of God went in to the daughters
of humans and they bore children to them. They were famous in the
eyes of the world, but fame and might did not mean goodness before
Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As generations passed, I looked upon
the earth and saw that humanity&rsquo;s wickedness had grown very
great. Every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only
evil continually&mdash;twisted desires, violence, cruelty, corruption
in every direction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was grieved in My heart over what
they had become.<BR>It brought Me sorrow that I had made humanity and
that they had turned so far from the good for which I had formed
them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I declared:<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have
created&mdash;and with them the animals, the creeping things, and the
birds of the heavens&mdash;for I am grieved that I have made
them.&rdquo;</FONT><BR>The creation I had called good was now
saturated with violence and corruption; judgment was the necessary
surgery on a diseased world.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Yet even then, I saw one man who
walked differently.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah found favor in My eyes.<BR>He
lived with integrity among his generation and walked with Me in trust
and obedience. He was not without flaw, but his heart was turned
toward Me rather than toward the evil that filled his world. Noah had
three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The earth before Me had become
ruined&mdash;twisted from its intended order&mdash;and was filled
with violence. I looked, and all flesh had corrupted its way on the
earth. People had defiled both themselves and the world I had given
them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I spoke to Noah, revealing what I
would do:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">The
end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with
violence because of them. I am going to bring an end to them with the
earth itself.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Make

it inside and out with pitch to seal it. This is how you are to build

breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. Make a roof for
the ark, and leave an opening near the top, a cubit high all around.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I laid out for Noah both the warning
of judgment and the way of preservation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah did this.<BR>He acted in
accordance with all that I commanded him. In a world that mocked and
ignored Me, he believed My word and shaped his life around it,
preparing for a storm the world did not yet see.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the ark was ready, I spoke to
Noah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said, <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Go
into the ark, you and all your household, because among the people of
this generation I have seen you as one who walks rightly before Me.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Take
with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;For in

every living thing that I have made.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah did everything I commanded him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah was six hundred years old when
the floodwaters came upon the earth. So Noah went into the ark, with
his sons, his wife, and his sons&rsquo; wives, to escape the waters
of the flood.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From the clean animals and the
animals that were not clean, from the birds, and from everything that
creeps on the ground, there came to Noah pairs&mdash;male and
female&mdash;just as I had ordered Noah. After seven days, the waters
of the flood came upon the earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the six hundredth year of Noah&rsquo;s
life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on
that very day all the springs of the great deep were broken open, and
the windows of the heavens were opened. Rain poured on the earth for
forty days and forty nights.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">On that same day Noah and his
sons&mdash;Shem, Ham, and Japheth&mdash;and Noah&rsquo;s wife and the
three wives of his sons entered the ark with him. They went in with
every kind of wild animal according to its kind, every kind of
livestock according to its kind, every creeping thing that moves on
the earth according to its kind, and every kind of bird according to
its kind, every winged creature.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They came to Noah and entered the
ark, two by two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as I had
commanded him. Then I shut him in. I Myself closed them in, sealing
them inside the refuge I had told him to build.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The flood came upon the earth for
forty days. The waters rose and lifted the ark, and it was carried
high above the earth. The waters increased and spread greatly over
the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The waters prevailed mightily on the
earth, until all the high mountains under the whole heaven were
covered. The waters rose more than fifteen cubits above the highest
peaks, and the mountains were submerged.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">All flesh that moved on the earth
perished&mdash;birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that
swarm on the earth, and all humankind. Everything on dry land whose
nostrils held the breath of life died. I wiped out every living thing
that was on the face of the ground&mdash;people, animals, creeping
things, and the birds of the heavens. They were removed from the
earth. Only Noah remained, and those who were with him in the ark.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The waters held sway over the earth
for one hundred and fifty days. Under the judgment I had declared,
the world was buried in deep water, while the small remnant I had
chosen was borne up in safety upon the flood.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I turned My attention toward Noah
and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. I
had not forgotten them; when I &ldquo;remembered&rdquo; them, I moved
to act for their deliverance.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I caused a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters began to subside. I closed the springs of the
deep and the windows of the heavens, and the rain from the sky was
restrained. Little by little, the waters drew back from the earth.
After a time, they had lessened enough that the ark came to rest on
the mountains of Ararat.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As the days passed, the waters
continued to retreat. In the tenth month, on the first day of the
month, the tops of the mountains became visible.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After forty more days, Noah opened
the window he had made in the ark. He sent out a raven, and it flew
back and forth over the waters, never finding a permanent resting
place while the earth was still covered.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he sent out a dove to see if
the waters had receded from the face of the ground. The dove found no
place to set her foot, because the water still covered the surface of
the whole earth. She returned to him in the ark, and Noah reached out
his hand, took her, and brought her back inside.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He waited seven more days and again
sent out the dove from the ark. This time, toward evening, the dove
came back to him, and in her beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf.
Then Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He waited another seven days and
sent out the dove once more. This time she did not return to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In Noah&rsquo;s six hundred and
first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the
waters had dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the
ark and looked; he saw that the surface of the ground was drying.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">By the twenty-seventh day of the
second month, the earth was dry.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I spoke to Noah:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Go out
of the ark, you and your wife, your sons, and your sons&rsquo; wives
with you.<BR>&ldquo;Bring out with you every living creature that is
with you&mdash;birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that moves
on the earth&mdash;so that they may swarm on the earth, and be
fruitful, and multiply on the earth.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah went out, with his sons, his
wife, and his sons&rsquo; wives. All the animals, all the creeping
things, and all the birds&mdash;everything that moves on the
earth&mdash;went out of the ark by their families.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Noah built an altar to Me. From
every kind of clean animal and every kind of clean bird, he took some
and offered them as burnt offerings on the altar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I took in the aroma of the offering,
and in My heart I declared:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;I will
not again curse the ground because of humankind, even though the
intention of the human heart is evil from youth.<BR>&ldquo;And I will
never again strike down every living thing as I have done.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;While
the earth remains,<BR>seedtime and harvest,<BR>cold and heat,<BR>summer
and winter,<BR>day and night<BR>shall not cease.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The waters of judgment had receded.
A cleansed earth lay before Noah and his family, and I set in My own
counsel the promise that, as long as the world endures, its ordered
rhythms will continue, and I will not again sweep away all flesh with
a flood.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">And for your
own blood, your lifeblood, I will demand an accounting. From every

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">Whoever sheds

fruitful and multiply; spread out over the earth and increase upon
it.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I spoke again to Noah and to
his sons with him:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Look, I
am establishing My covenant with you and with your descendants after
you, and with every living creature that is with you&mdash;the birds,

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">I establish My

waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy
the whole earth.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">I said, &ldquo;This
is the sign of the covenant that I am making between Me and you and
every living creature with you, for all generations to come: I have
set My bow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant
between Me and the earth.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">When I bring
clouds over the earth and the bow appears in the clouds, I will

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">When the bow
is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to Noah, <FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;This
is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and
all flesh that is on the earth.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sons of Noah who came out of the
ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan. From
these three the whole earth was repopulated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah began to cultivate the ground
again and planted a vineyard. In time he drank wine made from it,
became drunk, and lay uncovered in the middle of his tent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his
father&rsquo;s nakedness and went out and told his two brothers. Shem
and Japheth took a garment, laid it across their shoulders, walked
backward into the tent, and covered their father. They kept their
faces turned away so they did not see their father&rsquo;s nakedness.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Noah awoke from his wine and
learned what his youngest son had done, he spoke words that I
permitted to stand as a declaration over their lines:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;Cursed be
Canaan;<BR>a servant of servants<BR>he shall be to his brothers.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He also said,<BR>&ldquo;Blessed be

enlarge Japheth;<BR>let him dwell in the tents of Shem,<BR>and let
Canaan be his servant.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Noah lived three hundred and fifty
years after the flood. All the days of Noah were nine hundred and

the bow in the clouds, continued beyond his days for every generation
that followed.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After the flood, I watched the three
sons of Noah&mdash;Shem, Ham, and Japheth&mdash;and their children
begin to spread out. From them the families and nations of the earth
took shape.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These are their lines as I saw them
grow.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">First, the line of Japheth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sons of Japheth were Gomer,
Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.<BR>Gomer&rsquo;s sons
were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.<BR>Javan&rsquo;s sons were
Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From these, the peoples of the
coastlands and distant islands spread out, each clan in its own
territories, forming their own nations, and in time speaking their
own tongues. They moved along shorelines and sea routes, filling the
northern and far western lands.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Next, the line of Ham.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim,
Put, and Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah,
Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.<BR>The sons of Raamah were Sheba and
Dedan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Cush came a man named Nimrod. I
allowed him to become a mighty warrior on the earth. He grew to be
renowned, a powerful hunter before Me&mdash;so much so that people
would say, &ldquo;Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The beginnings of his kingdom were
in the land of Shinar: Babel, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh. From that
land he moved out toward Assyria and built cities: Nineveh,
Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and Resen, which lay between Nineveh and Calah, a
great city. Through him, city-building and empire took on a new,
concentrated form.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Mizraim became the ancestor of
peoples who settled the region later known as Egypt. From him came
the Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, Pathrusim, and Casluhim, from
whom the Philistines arose, and the Caphtorim. They occupied river
valleys and delta lands along the great river to the south.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Canaan&rsquo;s firstborn was Sidon,
who gave his name to a prominent coastal city. From Canaan also came
Heth, and the peoples known as the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. In
time, the Canaanite clans spread outward.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The territory of the Canaanites
extended from Sidon in the north, down toward Gerar as far as Gaza,
and eastward toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as
Lasha. I marked their borders as they took root in hills, plains, and
fortified towns.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were the sons of Ham,
according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then, the line of Shem.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Shem, the ancestor of all the
children of Eber, was the older brother of Japheth. The sons of Shem
were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul,
Gether, and Mash.<BR>Arphaxad became the father of Shelah, and Shelah
became the father of Eber.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To Eber two sons were born. The name
of one was Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided&mdash;I
would soon scatter peoples and languages, and his generation would
stand in that moment of division. His brother&rsquo;s name was
Joktan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joktan became the father of Almodad,
Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, Obal, Abimael,
Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. These clans settled from the region
of Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country. They spread
along trade routes, across deserts and mountains, forming peoples
known for caravans, incense, and gold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were the sons of Shem, by
their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So from the three sons of Noah&mdash;Shem,
Ham, and Japheth&mdash;came all the families that spread over the
whole earth after the flood. I watched as they took shape: tribes
becoming peoples, peoples becoming nations, each with its own place,
speech, and story under My sovereignty.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In those days, the whole earth still
used one language and the same words. I watched as people moved
together toward the east and settled on a wide plain in the land
later called Shinar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said to one another, &ldquo;Come,
let&rsquo;s make bricks and fire them thoroughly.&rdquo; Stone was
scarce there, so they used baked bricks for building and bitumen for
mortar. Then their plans grew bold. They said, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s
build ourselves a city, with a tower whose top reaches up toward the
heavens. Let&rsquo;s make a name for ourselves, or we will be
scattered over the face of the whole earth.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They wanted security and fame on
their own terms, resisting My purpose that they should fill the
earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I came down to see the city and the
tower that the children of humankind were building. Of course,
nothing was hidden from My sight, but I drew near to examine and to
act.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said within My counsel:<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Look,
they are one people, and they all have one language. This is only the
beginning of what they will do. Now nothing that they plan to do will
be restrained from them.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Their unity, turned away from Me,
would harden into proud rebellion and self-exaltation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I determined:<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Come,
let Us go down and confuse their language, so that they will not
understand one another&rsquo;s speech.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I intervened. I broke their proud
oneness not by destroying them, but by dividing their words. Suddenly
they could no longer understand each other clearly. Their cooperation
faltered, their plans collapsed in confusion. They stopped building
the city because they could not speak as one.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From there I scattered them over the
face of the whole earth. Different speech led to different groups,
and different groups moved to different lands. The city came to be
called Babel, because there I confused the language of the whole
earth, and from there I dispersed them abroad.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Yet even as I scattered them, My
purpose did not end with judgment. I was already preparing to call
one man and one family through whom I would bless all the scattered
nations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This is the family record that leads
from Shem to that man.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Shem was one hundred years old when,
two years after the flood, he became the father of Arphaxad. After
Arphaxad&rsquo;s birth, Shem lived many more years and had other sons
and daughters. His line continued.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Arphaxad in time became the father
of Shelah, and after Shelah&rsquo;s birth he lived on and had sons
and daughters.<BR>Shelah became the father of Eber, and his life also
stretched on for years, with other children born to him.<BR>Eber
became the father of Peleg. In Peleg&rsquo;s days, the earth&rsquo;s
peoples were divided; the scattering I brought at Babel marked his
generation. Eber had other sons and daughters as well.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Peleg became the father of Reu; Reu
became the father of Serug; Serug became the father of Nahor; Nahor
became the father of Terah. Each of these men lived out their years,
had sons and daughters, and passed from the earth, while My plan
flowed quietly through their line.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Terah became the father of three
sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. While
Terah was still alive, Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the
Chaldeans. Death and grief touched this family, even as I was shaping
their future.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram and Nahor took wives. Abram&rsquo;s
wife was named Sarai, and Nahor&rsquo;s wife was named Milcah, the
daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. Sarai was unable
to have children; she was barren. Yet I had chosen her, and through
her barrenness I would later show My power to give life where there
was none.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Terah gathered his family to leave
Ur of the Chaldeans, intending to go to the land of Canaan. He took
his son Abram, his grandson Lot (son of Haran), and Sarai, his
daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram. They set out together from Ur,
traveling northwest.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When they reached a place called
Haran, they settled there and did not go farther. Terah lived two
hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There, with a grieving family in a
city of transition, My next word was ready. From this scattered
earth, from these long lines of fathers and sons, from this household
paused on the way to Canaan, I would call Abram by name and begin a
new chapter of promise for all nations.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5>Genesis 12 &ndash;
The Call That Shook The World</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I spoke to Abram while he was still
living among his kin and his father&rsquo;s house. My words cut
across his settled life like a blade through old rope.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him:<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Leave
your land,<BR>your relatives,<BR>and your father&rsquo;s
household,<BR>and go to the land that I will show you.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">I will make
you into a great nation.<BR>I will bless you<BR>and make your name
great,<BR>and you will be a blessing.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">I will bless
those who bless you,<BR>and whoever treats you with contempt I will
curse.<BR>In you all the families of the earth will be blessed.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I did not show him the whole road,
only the direction. I gave him a promise and a command and watched to
see what he would do.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram obeyed. He went out as I had
spoken to him. Lot, his brother&rsquo;s son, went with him. Abram was
seventy-five years old when he left Haran. He took Sarai his wife,
Lot his nephew, and all the possessions they had gathered, along with
the people of their household, and set out for the land of Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They entered Canaan. Abram passed
through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The
Canaanites were living in the land then, rooted and strong. To human
eyes, Abram was a foreigner with a small caravan. To Me, he was the
carrier of a promise that would outlast kingdoms.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There I appeared to Abram and
said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;To your offspring I will give
this land.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He answered Me not with many words,
but with an altar. He built an altar there to Me, the LORD who had
appeared to him. Where others trusted fortified cities and idols,
Abram called on My name.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From there he moved to the hill
country east of Bethel and set up his tent, with Bethel on the west
and Ai on the east. There he built another altar to Me and called
upon My name. He was still a wanderer, but now his steps were aligned
with My purpose. He journeyed on, moving by stages toward the Negev.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then came famine in the land. The
very place I had led him became hard and lean. Food was scarce,
hunger pressing in. Abram decided to go down into Egypt to live there
for a while, because the famine was severe in Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As they approached Egypt, fear rose
in him. Sarai was beautiful, even in her later years, and Abram was
afraid the Egyptians would kill him to take her. He said to Sarai,
&ldquo;Look, I know that you are a beautiful woman. When the
Egyptians see you, they will say, &lsquo;This is his wife,&rsquo; and
they will kill me but let you live. Say you are my sister, so that it
may go well with me because of you, and my life will be spared on
your account.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He trusted Me enough to leave his
home, but in this, his fear drove him to half-truth and compromise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Abram entered Egypt, the
Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. Pharaoh&rsquo;s
officials noticed her and praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken
into Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. For her sake, Pharaoh treated Abram well:
he had sheep, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female
servants, and camels.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But I watched over My promise and
over Sarai, whom I had chosen to be the mother of the line I would
raise up. I struck Pharaoh and his household with great plagues
because of Sarai, Abram&rsquo;s wife. I defended My covenant even
when Abram failed to do what was right.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh summoned Abram and said,
&ldquo;What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me she
is your wife? Why did you say, &lsquo;She is my sister,&rsquo; so
that I took her to be my wife? Now here is your wife. Take her and
go.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh commanded his men concerning
Abram, and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.
Abram left Egypt richer than when he entered, but he carried with him
the knowledge that I had rescued him in spite of his fear, not
because of his wisdom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had called him out, I had promised
him blessing, and I had begun to show him that My faithfulness would
be the backbone of the story, not his perfection.</P>
<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5><B>Genesis 13 &ndash;
The Great Separation And The Promise In The Dust</B></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram went up from Egypt into the
Negev, taking Sarai, Lot, and everything they possessed. I had
preserved him in Egypt, and he left that land very rich in livestock,
silver, and gold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He moved from place to place in the
Negev until he came back to the region between Bethel and Ai, to the
place where his tent had been at the beginning, and where he had
first built an altar. There Abram called on My name again. He
returned not only to that place, but to the worship he had first
shown Me there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot, who was traveling with Abram,
also had flocks, herds, and tents. Their possessions grew so great
that the land where they were staying could not support them both
together. Their herdsmen began to quarrel. Strife rose where there
should have been unity.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At that time the Canaanites and
Perizzites were also living in the land, filling the valleys and
hills with their own cities and fields. Space and tension pressed in
from every side.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram chose peace. He said to Lot,
&ldquo;Let there be no strife between you and me, or between your
herdsmen and mine, for we are close relatives. Is not the whole land
before you? Separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I
will go to the right; if you go to the right, then I will go to the
left.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was willing to yield visible
advantage because he trusted the unseen promise I had given him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot lifted up his eyes and looked.
He saw that the whole plain of the Jordan, toward Zoar, was well
watered everywhere&mdash;like My garden had once been, like the land
of Egypt he had just left. This was before I destroyed Sodom and
Gomorrah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot chose for himself all the Jordan
plain and set out toward the east. So they separated from each other.
Abram stayed in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the
cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The people of Sodom were wicked and
sinned greatly against Me. Lot had chosen by sight, not by seeking My
will, and he drew his tents close to a city that was already rotting
inside.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After Lot had parted from Abram, I
spoke to Abram again. With his camp now quieter and his circle
smaller, I opened My promise wider.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Lift
up your eyes from the place where you are,<BR>and look north and
south, east and west;<BR>for all the land that you see<BR>I will give
to you and to your offspring forever.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;I will
make your offspring like the dust of the earth,<BR>so that if anyone
could count the dust of the earth,<BR>then your offspring also could
be counted.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Rise,
walk through the length and breadth of the land,<BR>for I am giving
it to you.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I asked him to look, to trust, and
to walk&mdash;long before he possessed anything more than a tent and
an altar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram moved his tents and went to
live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron. There he built another
altar to Me. While Lot settled near a corrupt city, Abram settled
near My promise, marking the land not with walls and towers, but with
worship.</P>

War Of Kings And The Priest In The Shadows</B></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the days when kingdoms were still
young and cities were rising from the dust, conflict flared in the
lands around the Dead Sea.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Four kings joined forces:<BR>Amraphel
king of Shinar,<BR>Arioch king of Ellasar,<BR>Chedorlaomer king of
Elam,<BR>and Tidal king of nations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They made war against five local
kings:<BR>Bera king of Sodom,<BR>Birsha king of Gomorrah,<BR>Shinab
king of Admah,<BR>Shemeber king of Zeboiim,<BR>and the king of Bela
(that is, Zoar).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">For twelve years the cities of the
plain had served Chedorlaomer. In the thirteenth year they rebelled.
In the fourteenth year he and his allies marched out to crush them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as they swept through the
region: they struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in
Ham, the Emim in the plain of Kiriathaim, and the Horites in the hill
country of Seir, pushing south toward El-paran by the wilderness.
Then they turned back, passed through En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh),
and struck the territory of the Amalekites and the Amorites who lived
in Hazazon-tamar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At last, the kings of Sodom,
Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela drew up their forces in the Valley
of Siddim, a valley full of bitumen pits. They faced the four kings
of the east in open battle.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The four kings overpowered the five.
The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; some of their men fell into the
tar pits, and the rest ran to the hills. The victors took all the
goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and went away.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Among the captives was Lot, Abram&rsquo;s
nephew, who had settled in Sodom. They carried off Lot and his
possessions and left, not knowing whose relative they had touched.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">One who escaped came and told Abram
the Hebrew. Abram was living by the great trees of Mamre the Amorite,
brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were allies with him. I had already
knit these men to Abram for this very moment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Abram heard that his kinsman
had been taken captive, he did not hesitate. He armed the 318 trained
men born in his household and set out in pursuit, with his allies at
his side. To human eyes, a small force chasing four victorious kings
was madness. To Me, it was an opportunity to show that My strength is
not measured in numbers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram caught up with them near Dan.
By night he divided his forces, attacked, and struck them. I
delivered the enemy into his hand. He pursued them as far as Hobah,
north of Damascus. He brought back all the goods and also brought
back Lot, his kinsman, with his possessions, the women, and the rest
of the people. What the great cities could not defend, I restored
through one man who trusted Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As Abram returned from defeating
Chedorlaomer and the kings with him, the king of Sodom came out to
meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King&rsquo;s Valley).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then another king stepped out of the
shadows of history&mdash;a man whose name would echo long after he
was gone.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought
out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, the same Most
High whom Abram worshiped, Maker of heaven and earth. In a land
filled with idols, this king-priest stood as a quiet witness that I
still had servants beyond Abram&rsquo;s tent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He blessed Abram and said:<BR>&ldquo;Blessed
be Abram by God Most High,<BR>Maker of heaven and earth;<BR>and
blessed be God Most High,<BR>who has delivered your enemies into your
hand.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Melchizedek&rsquo;s words were true:
it was My hand that had given victory. Abram knew this, and he gave
Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had taken. In this, Abram
honored Me as the source of his success, not his own strength.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the king of Sodom spoke to
Abram:<BR>&ldquo;Give me the people, and take the goods for
yourself.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched the choice before Abram:
to take wealth from a corrupt king, or to stand firmly on My
provision.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram replied to the king of
Sodom:<BR>&ldquo;I have raised my hand in an oath to the LORD, God
Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, that I will not take anything
that is yours&mdash;not even a thread or a sandal strap&mdash;so that
you can never say, &lsquo;I made Abram rich.&rsquo;<BR>I will take
nothing for myself except what the young men have eaten, and the
share that belongs to Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their
portion.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He refused the spoils that would tie
his name to Sodom&rsquo;s king. He chose to let his wealth be clearly
seen as My gift, not a payoff from a corrupt ruler.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched My servant return to his
tents with fewer treasures than he might have claimed, but with his
integrity stronger and his dependence on Me more deeply rooted. Soon
I would speak to him again and enlarge My promise&mdash;but already,
in war and in restraint, he was learning what it meant to live by
faith in Me, God Most High.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After these events, I spoke to Abram
in a vision.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Do
not be afraid, Abram.<BR>I am your shield.<BR>I Myself am your very
great reward.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram answered Me from the place of
his disappointment. He said,<BR>&ldquo;Lord GOD, what can You give
me? I am still without children, and the one who will inherit my
house is Eliezer of Damascus. You have not given me a child; a
servant born in my household is my heir.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke honestly; I did not rebuke
him for bringing his doubt to Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I replied,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;This
man will not be your heir.<BR>A son from your own body will be your
heir.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I brought him outside under the
night sky. I showed him what I had already made as a picture of what
I would yet do.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Look
up at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count
them.<BR>That is how your offspring will be.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram believed Me. He trusted My
word against what his eyes and age told him. I counted that faith to
him as righteousness. His right standing before Me was grounded not
in his flawless behavior, but in his trust in My promise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;I
am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you
this land to possess.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram asked,<BR>&ldquo;Lord GOD, how
can I know that I will really take possession of it?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I stooped down to his level of
understanding and gave him a covenant sign in the form of a solemn,
ancient rite.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Bring
Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a
three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram brought all these to Me. He
cut the larger animals in two and arranged the halves opposite each
other, forming a pathway between the pieces. The birds he did not cut
in two. Carrion birds came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove
them away. He waited, watching, as the blood darkened on the ground
and the sun moved toward the horizon.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As the sun was going down, a deep,
heavy sleep fell on Abram. A thick and dreadful darkness came over
him. In that darkness, I spoke about a future he would not see with
his own eyes, but which I already held in My hand.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;Know
for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is
not theirs.<BR>They will be enslaved there and oppressed for four
hundred years.<BR>But I will judge the nation that enslaves them,<BR>and
afterward they will come out with great possessions.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;But you
will go to your fathers in peace.<BR>You will be buried at a good old
age.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;In the
fourth generation, your descendants will return here,<BR>for the sin
of the Amorites is not yet full.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I tied My promise to history yet to
come: slavery and deliverance, delay and judgment, timing and justice
that only I could fully see.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the sun had set and darkness
was fully over the land, I passed through the pieces Myself in
visible sign. Abram lay helpless in his deep sleep; he did not walk
the path of blood. I alone took the path of obligation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">A smoking firepot and a blazing
torch appeared&mdash;signs of My presence&mdash;and passed between
the divided pieces of the animals. In this way I cut a covenant with
Abram that day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I declared,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;To

Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I bound Myself with a promise marked

cancel My word. The covenant rested on Me. I would carry it through.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She had an Egyptian servant named

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram listened to Sarai&rsquo;s

tried to turn her into a shortcut to My promise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After they had lived ten years in

Abram as a secondary wife. Abram went in to Hagar, and she conceived.</P>

said,<BR>&ldquo;This wrong is your fault. I put my servant into your
arms, and now that she sees she is pregnant, she looks down on me.
May the LORD judge between me and you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram answered,<BR>&ldquo;Look, your
servant is in your hands. Do whatever you think is best.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Sarai dealt harshly with Hagar.
The tension and cruelty drove Hagar to run. She fled from her
mistress into the wilderness, alone, wounded, and pregnant, heading
toward the desert on the way to Shur.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I saw her. I had not forgotten the
servant cast aside on the road.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My messenger, the angel of the LORD,
found Hagar by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the
way to Shur. He spoke with My own authority.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;Hagar, servant of
Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She answered honestly,<BR>&ldquo;I
am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then My messenger said,<BR>&ldquo;Return
to your mistress and submit to her authority.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This was not approval of Sarai&rsquo;s
harshness, but a call for Hagar to step back into the place where I
would weave her story into larger purposes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I gave her a promise of her
own.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The angel of the LORD said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;I
will greatly multiply your descendants<BR>so that they will be too
many to count.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">He also
said,<BR>&ldquo;You are now pregnant<BR>and will bear a son.<BR>You
shall name him Ishmael,<BR>for the LORD has heard your affliction.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&ldquo;He will
be a wild donkey of a man&mdash;<BR>his hand against everyone,<BR>and
everyone&rsquo;s hand against him;<BR>and he will live in conflict<BR>in
the presence of all his relatives.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had heard her misery. I saw her
oppression. Her son would not be forgotten or small; he would be
strong, restless, and always on the edge of others&rsquo; lands and
lives.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There by the spring, Hagar responded
to Me in a way no one else had yet put into words.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She gave Me a name and said,<BR>&ldquo;You
are a God of seeing,&rdquo;<BR>for she said,<BR>&ldquo;Truly here I
have seen the One who looks after me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the well was called
Beer-lahai-roi&mdash;&ldquo;the well of the Living One who sees me.&rdquo;
It lay between Kadesh and Bered, marked forever by the moment a
runaway servant discovered she was not invisible to Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Hagar returned. In due time she bore
Abram a son. Abram named the boy Ishmael, just as I had said. Abram
was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram still did not yet see how My
promise would unfold through Sarah, but I had already woven another
line into the story through Hagar and her son.<BR>I had seen the
proud, the barren, and the fleeing slave. None of them were hidden
from My eyes.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Abram was ninety-nine years
old, I appeared to him again.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;I
am God Almighty.<BR>Walk before Me and be blameless.<BR>I will set My

n</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">um</FONT><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">bers.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abram fell facedown before Me. There
on the ground, old and small, he listened while I unfolded more of
what I had already promised.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;As
for Me, this is My covenant with you:<BR>You will be the father of
many nations.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;No

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;I will
establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant<BR>between Me and
you and your descendants after you<BR>for all generations to come&mdash;<BR>to
be your God and the God of your descendants.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#cc0000">&ldquo;I will
give to you and to your offspring after you<BR>the land where you are
now a foreigner&mdash;<BR>all the land of Canaan&mdash;<BR>as an
everlasting possession,<BR>and I will be their God.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I spoke to Abraham about his
part in this covenant, a visible sign written into his very flesh and
into his family.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;As
for you, you must keep My covenant&mdash;<BR>you and your descendants
after you for all generations.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;This is

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;You are

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;For
every generation,<BR>every male among you who is eight days old must

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Both
the one born in your house<BR>and the one bought with money<BR>must
be circumcised.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;So My
covenant in your flesh<BR>will be an everlasting covenant.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Any
uncircumcised male<BR>who has not been circumcised in the flesh of
his foreskin<BR>shall be cut off from his people;<BR>he has broken My

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I bound My invisible promise to a
physical mark, so that every generation would remember that their
bodies and their future belonged to Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I spoke concerning his wife.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;As
for Sarai your wife,<BR>you shall no longer call her Sarai.<BR>Her
name will be Sarah.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I will
bless her,<BR>and I will surely give you a son by her.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I will
bless her so that she becomes mother of nations;<BR>kings of peoples
will come from her.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham fell facedown again, but
this time he laughed to himself. He said in his heart,<BR>&ldquo;Can
a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?<BR>Can Sarah
bear a child at ninety?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he said aloud to Me,<BR>&ldquo;Oh,
that Ishmael might live under Your favor!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was trying to offer Me the son he
already had, shaped by human planning, instead of the son I had
promised, born by My power.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I answered,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;No&mdash;your
wife Sarah will bear you a son,<BR>and you will name him Isaac.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I will
establish My covenant with him<BR>as an everlasting covenant<BR>for

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;As for
Ishmael, I have heard you.<BR>I will bless him.<BR>I will make him

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;He will

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;But My

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When I had finished speaking with
Abraham, I went up from him. My words were clear; the promises were
set. The time for delay was past; the time for obedience had come.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">That very day Abraham acted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He took his son Ishmael, all those
born in his household, and all who had been bought with his
money&mdash;every male among the men of Abraham&rsquo;s house&mdash;and
he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins just as I had told him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham was ninety-nine years old
when he was circumcised. His son Ishmael was thirteen years old when
he was circumcised. On that very day, Abraham and his son Ishmael
were circumcised, along with all the men of his household, both those
born there and those bought with money from foreigners.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">By blood and pain, they marked
themselves as Mine.<BR>By new names, I marked Abraham and Sarah as
carriers of My promise.<BR>The old man and the barren woman were now
the ones through whom I would raise a people and unfold My plan for
the world.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5><B>Genesis 18 &ndash;
Tents, Laughter, And A Bargain Over A Burning City</B></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I came to Abraham again by the great
trees of Mamre.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">It was the heat of the day; Abraham
was sitting at the entrance of his tent. He lifted up his eyes and
saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the tent
door to meet them and bowed himself to the ground.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was among those three, with two of
My messengers at My side, all appearing in human form.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham said,<BR>&ldquo;My Lord, if
I have found favor in Your sight, do not pass Your servant by.<BR>Let
a little water be brought, and let me wash Your feet, and rest
yourselves under the tree.<BR>Let me bring a bit of bread, that you
may refresh yourselves;<BR>after that you may go on&mdash;since you
have come to your servant.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He wanted to honor Me, even though
he did not yet fully grasp who stood before him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I answered,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Do
as you have said.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham hurried into the tent to
Sarah and said,<BR>&ldquo;Quick! Take three measures of fine flour,
knead it, and make cakes.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he ran to the herd, chose a
tender, choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare
it. He took curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and
set it before Us. He stood by under the tree while We ate. His
hospitality rose before Me as a quiet testimony of his faith.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Where
is Sarah your wife?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham replied,<BR>&ldquo;There, in
the tent.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will surely return to you about this time next year,<BR>and Sarah
your wife will have a son.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah was listening at the tent door
behind him. Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in years; the
way of women had ceased for Sarah. She heard My words measured
against her body&rsquo;s reality and her long history of
disappointment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah laughed to herself and said in
her heart,<BR>&ldquo;After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I
have pleasure?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I heard her silent laugh and the
doubt behind it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to Abraham,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Why
did Sarah laugh and say, &lsquo;Shall I indeed bear a child, now that
I am old?&rsquo;<BR>Is anything too hard for the LORD?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;At the
set time I will return to you,<BR>about this time next year,<BR>and
Sarah will have a son.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah, afraid, denied it. She
said,<BR>&ldquo;I did not laugh.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;No,
you did laugh.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I did not crush her for her fear and
disbelief; I named it. Soon I would turn that laugh of doubt into a
laugh of joy, and the son&rsquo;s very name would carry her story.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the men rose from there and
looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked with Us to send Us on
Our way.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said within My own counsel,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Shall
I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,<BR>seeing that he will
surely become a great and mighty nation,<BR>and all the nations of
the earth will be blessed through him?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;For I
have chosen him,<BR>that he may command his children and his
household after him<BR>to keep the way of the LORD<BR>by doing
righteousness and justice,<BR>so that I may bring upon Abraham what I
have spoken about him.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I spoke out My purpose to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;The
outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great,<BR>and their sin is very
grave.<BR>I will go down and see whether they have done
altogether<BR>according to the cry that has come up to Me;<BR>and if
not, I will know.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The two men turned and went toward
Sodom, but Abraham still stood before Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Abraham drew near and spoke.<BR>He
said,<BR>&ldquo;Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the
wicked?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Suppose there are fifty
righteous within the city&mdash;<BR>will You really sweep it away<BR>and
not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in
it?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Far be it from You to do such
a thing&mdash;<BR>to put the righteous to death with the wicked,<BR>so
that the righteous fare as the wicked!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Far be that from You!<BR>Shall
not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I welcomed his boldness. He was
learning to stand in the gap, to appeal to My justice and My mercy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;If
I find in Sodom fifty righteous people in the city,<BR>then I will
spare the whole place for their sake.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham answered,<BR>&ldquo;Look, I
have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord,<BR>even though I am but
dust and ashes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Suppose five are lacking from
the fifty righteous&mdash;<BR>will You destroy the whole city for
lack of five?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I replied,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke again,<BR>&ldquo;Suppose
forty are found there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will not do it for the sake of forty.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;Please do not be
angry, Lord, and I will speak.<BR>Suppose thirty are found there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I answered,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will not do it if I find thirty there.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;Look, I have
taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.<BR>Suppose twenty are found
there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;Please do not let
the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more.<BR>Suppose ten
are found there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I replied,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I
will not destroy it for the sake of ten.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In every step down, I showed him
that I take no pleasure in destruction, and that even a small remnant
of righteousness has weight before Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When I had finished speaking with
Abraham, I went My way, and Abraham returned to his place. The two
messengers went on toward Sodom, and the next chapter of judgment and
rescue was about to unfold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But under that hot tree at Mamre, I
had done two things:<BR>I had marked a time for impossible joy in
Sarah&rsquo;s womb,<BR>and I had drawn Abraham into My own heart for
justice and mercy over a doomed city.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The two messengers who had been with
Me at Mamre came to Sodom in the evening. Lot was sitting in the gate
of the city, a place of status and judgment among the people.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Lot saw them, he got up to meet
them and bowed with his face to the ground.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;My lords, please
turn aside to your servant&rsquo;s house. Spend the night, wash your
feet; then you can rise early and go on your way.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said,<BR>&ldquo;No, we will
spend the night in the town square.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Lot knew the darkness that ruled
that city. He insisted strongly, pressing them until they turned
aside and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them&mdash;baked
unleavened bread&mdash;and they ate.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before they lay down, the men of the
city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house&mdash;young and old, all
the people from every quarter. They called out to Lot:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Where are the men who came to
you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may abuse them.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Their desire was violent and
shameless. The outcry that had risen to Me from Sodom now stood
exposed in the street.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot went out to them at the doorway
and shut the door behind him. He said,<BR>&ldquo;Please, my brothers,
do not do this wicked thing.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He pleaded, but he was tangled in
the city&rsquo;s corrupt ways and values. In his desperation he even
offered his own daughters to divert their rage, showing how deeply
the city&rsquo;s darkness had affected him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The men of Sodom raged back:<BR>&ldquo;Stand
aside!&rdquo;<BR>They said, &ldquo;This fellow came here as a
foreigner, and now he acts as a judge. We will treat you worse than
them.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They pressed hard against Lot and
came near to break down the door.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the men inside&mdash;the
messengers I had sent&mdash;reached out, pulled Lot into the house
with them, and shut the door. They struck the men at the door of the
house, from the youngest to the oldest, with blindness, so that they
wore themselves out groping for the door.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the messengers said to Lot,<BR>&ldquo;Do
you have anyone else here&mdash;sons, daughters, sons-in-law, anyone
you have in the city? Get them out of this place, for we are about to
destroy this city. The outcry against its people has become so great
before the LORD that He has sent us to destroy it.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot went out and spoke to his
sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said,<BR>&ldquo;Get
up, get out of this place! The LORD is going to destroy the city!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But to his sons-in-law he seemed to
be joking. They did not believe judgment was near.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When morning dawned, the messengers
urged Lot, saying,<BR>&ldquo;Get up! Take your wife and your two
daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment
of the city.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot hesitated. His heart was slow to
leave what he knew, even as death hung over it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Because of My compassion for him, My
messengers seized his hand, and the hands of his wife and his two
daughters, and led them out of the city and set them outside. I was
merciful to them when they could not move themselves.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When they had brought them out, one
said,<BR>&ldquo;Escape for your life! Do not look back, and do not
stay anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, or you will be
destroyed.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Lot said to them,<BR>&ldquo;No, my
lords, please. You have shown your servant great kindness by sparing
my life, but I cannot flee to the hills; disaster will overtake me,
and I will die. See, there is a small town nearby, easily reached.
Let me flee there&mdash;is it not a little one? Then my life will be
spared.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He clung to something small and
near, afraid to trust the wild hills.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">One of them said,<BR>&ldquo;Very
well, I grant you this request also. I will not overthrow the town of
which you speak. Hurry, escape there, for I can do nothing until you
arrive there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">That town was called Zoar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sun had risen over the land when
Lot entered Zoar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I acted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I rained down burning sulfur on
Sodom and Gomorrah&mdash;from the LORD out of the heavens. I
overthrew those cities, the entire plain, all the inhabitants, and
what grew on the ground. The corruption that had ripened beyond
remedy met My judgment in a day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Lot&rsquo;s wife, following
behind him, looked back toward the city with longing. She turned and
became a pillar of salt&mdash;fixed, frozen between past and
deliverance. My command had been clear; her heart still clung to what
I was destroying.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Early that same morning, Abraham
went to the place where he had stood before Me. He looked down toward
Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain. He saw dense smoke
rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When I destroyed the cities of the
plain, I remembered Abraham. I brought Lot out of the catastrophe
that overthrew the cities where he had lived. My mercy to the nephew
was tied to My covenant friend on the hill.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Afterward, Lot was afraid to stay in
Zoar. He went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two
daughters. He settled in a cave, a small, fearful life carved into
stone, far from the city he had once chosen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The daughters saw no future. They
thought there was no man left for them, that the line of their father
would end in that cave.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The older said to the younger,<BR>&ldquo;Our
father is old, and there is no man around to come in to us in the
usual way. Come, let&rsquo;s make our father drink wine, and lie with
him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They should have trusted Me;
instead, they repeated the old pattern of human schemes around My
promises. They made Lot drunk and lay with him on two successive
nights. He was not aware of what they did; their sin was deliberate,
his part confused and clouded.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The older daughter bore a son and
named him Moab&mdash;he became the ancestor of the Moabites.<BR>The
younger daughter also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi&mdash;he
became the ancestor of the Ammonites.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Even out of this twisted choice, I
would later draw threads of My story. Yet the whole chapter stands as
a warning: where hearts cling to corrupt cities or desperate schemes,
ruin follows; where I rescue, it is sheer mercy.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham moved on from the ruins of
the plain. He traveled to the Negev region and settled between Kadesh
and Shur. From there he stayed for a time in Gerar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Once again, fear stirred in him. He
said of Sarah his wife, &ldquo;She is my sister.&rdquo; He repeated
the old half-truth he had used before in Egypt. Sarah agreed and hid
behind that same thin cover.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent men
and took Sarah into his household. He did not know she was Abraham&rsquo;s
wife. From his point of view, he was dealing honorably with a
foreigner&rsquo;s &ldquo;sister.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I stepped in.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I came to Abimelech in a dream by
night and said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Behold, you
are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a
man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Startled and afraid, Abimelech
answered Me in the dream:<BR>&ldquo;Lord, will You slay even a
righteous nation?<BR>Did he not say to me, &lsquo;She is my
sister&rsquo;?<BR>And she herself said, &lsquo;He is my brother.&rsquo;<BR>In
the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done
this.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I saw his heart. He had acted in
ignorance, though he was about to touch what I had set apart.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him in the dream,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Yes,
I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart,<BR>and
it was I who kept you from sinning against Me.<BR>That is why I did
not let you touch her.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Now
therefore, return the man&rsquo;s wife,<BR>for he is a prophet,<BR>and
he will pray for you and you shall live.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;But if
you do not return her,<BR>know that you shall surely die,<BR>you and
all who are yours.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before Abraham ever saw his promised
son, I was already treating him as a prophet&mdash;one whose prayers
would stand between life and death.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abimelech rose early in the morning.
He called all his servants and told them all these things, and the
men were very afraid. The dream I gave him shook not only the king
but his whole household.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Abimelech called Abraham and
said,<BR>&ldquo;What have you done to us?<BR>How have I sinned
against you,<BR>that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great
sin?<BR>You have done to me things that ought not to be done.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abimelech said to Abraham,<BR>&ldquo;What
did you see here,<BR>that you did this thing?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham answered with his mixture of
fear and reasoning:<BR>&ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;Surely there is no
fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my
wife.&rsquo;<BR>Besides, she really is my sister,<BR>the daughter of
my father but not the daughter of my mother;<BR>she became my wife.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;And when God caused me to
wander from my father&rsquo;s house,<BR>I said to her, &lsquo;This is
the kindness you must do for me:<BR>in every place we go, say of me,
&ldquo;He is my brother.&rdquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He had built a lifelong survival
plan on half-truth and distrust, even while walking under My promise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abimelech took sheep and oxen, male
and female servants, and gave them to Abraham. He returned Sarah,
Abraham&rsquo;s wife, to him. Abimelech said,<BR>&ldquo;Behold, my
land is before you; dwell wherever it pleases you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To Sarah he said,<BR>&ldquo;Behold,
I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver.<BR>This is a
vindication before all who are with you;<BR>before everyone you are
completely cleared.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He honored her publicly, making it
clear that she had not been defiled and that her reputation was
intact.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Abraham prayed to Me on
Abimelech&rsquo;s behalf. I listened.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I healed Abimelech, his wife, and
his female servants, and they began to bear children again. For I had
closed fast every womb in Abimelech&rsquo;s household because of
Sarah, Abraham&rsquo;s wife. I had guarded the line through which My
promise would come, shutting and then reopening wombs to make clear
My hand in the matter.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham&rsquo;s fear had put My
promise at risk; My protection and Abimelech&rsquo;s obedience had
preserved it.<BR>Even in My prophet&rsquo;s failure, I showed that My
purposes move forward by My mercy, not his perfection.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At the time I had set, I visited
Sarah just as I had promised.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah conceived and bore a son to
Abraham in his old age, at the very season I had spoken to him. My
word had waited through doubt, schemes, and years&mdash;then it
arrived exactly on time.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham named the son who was born
to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac&mdash;&ldquo;He Laughs.&rdquo;
The name carried Sarah&rsquo;s hidden laugh of disbelief and the new
laugh of joy I had brought from her barren body.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Isaac was eight days old,
Abraham circumcised him, just as I had commanded. Abraham was one
hundred years old when Isaac was born to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah said,<BR>&ldquo;God has made
laughter for me;<BR>everyone who hears will laugh with me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She also said,<BR>&ldquo;Who would
have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?<BR>Yet I have
borne him a son in his old age.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had turned the long ache of her
barrenness into a testimony that no one could have imagined.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The child grew and was weaned. On
the day Isaac was weaned, Abraham held a great feast. Joy and
celebration filled the camp.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But underneath the laughter, tension
rose.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
Egyptian&mdash;the boy Ishmael&mdash;mocking. The child born through
human planning now mocked the child born through My promise. Sarah&rsquo;s
jealousy and fear for Isaac&rsquo;s future ignited.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said to Abraham,<BR>&ldquo;Drive
out this slave woman and her son,<BR>for the son of this slave woman
shall not share the inheritance with my son Isaac.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Her words grieved Abraham deeply,
because Ishmael was his son too. He loved the boy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I spoke to Abraham.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Do
not be distressed because of the boy and your slave woman.<BR>Listen
to Sarah in all that she says to you,<BR>for through Isaac your
offspring will be named.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;And I
will also make a nation of the son of the slave woman,<BR>because he
is your offspring.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I would not abandon Ishmael. Even in
a broken household, I would turn both lines into nations, though only
one would carry My covenant.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Early the next morning, Abraham
rose. He took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar,
placing them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy. He sent her away.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Hagar departed and wandered in the
wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, the
desert&rsquo;s harshness closed in. She set the boy under one of the
shrubs, then went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said,<BR>&ldquo;Let me not look
on the death of the child.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As she sat opposite him, she lifted
up her voice and wept.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I heard the voice of the boy. Even
in his weakness and thirst, his cry reached Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My angel called to Hagar from heaven
and said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;What troubles you, Hagar?</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Do not
be afraid,<BR>for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Get
up,<BR>lift up the boy,<BR>and hold him fast with your hand,<BR>for I
will make him into a great nation.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I opened her eyes, and she saw
a well of water. It had been there, but her despair had blinded her.
She went, filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was with the boy as he grew up.<BR>He
settled in the wilderness and became an archer.<BR>He lived in the
wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land
of Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My promise to Abraham now stretched
in two directions: Isaac in tents in Canaan, Ishmael in the wild
lands to the south. Both lines under My eye.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Some time later, Abimelech came to
Abraham with Phicol, the commander of his army. Abimelech said,<BR>&ldquo;God
is with you in all that you do.<BR>Now therefore swear to me here by
God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my children or
with my descendants.<BR>Show to me and to the land where you have
lived as a foreigner the same kindness that I have shown you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham said,<BR>&ldquo;I will
swear.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Abraham also complained to
Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech&rsquo;s servants had
seized. Abimelech answered,<BR>&ldquo;I do not know who has done this
thing.<BR>You did not tell me, and I have heard of it only today.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Abraham took sheep and oxen and
gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs
from the flock. Abimelech said,<BR>&ldquo;What is the meaning of
these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham replied,<BR>&ldquo;You will
accept these seven ewe lambs from my hand so that this may be a
witness for me that I dug this well.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Therefore that place was called
Beersheba&mdash;&ldquo;Well of the Oath&rdquo; or &ldquo;Well of
Seven&rdquo;&mdash;because there they both swore an oath.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They made a covenant there. Then
Abimelech and Phicol rose and returned to the land of the
Philistines.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at
Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting
God. Under that tree, beside that well, he worshiped the One who had
given him a son, preserved another in the desert, and secured water
and peace in a foreign land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham lived as an alien many days
in the land of the Philistines.<BR>He was still a stranger, still
living in tents, but now with a laughing son by his side, a treaty at
his well, and My everlasting name on his lips.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After these things, I tested
Abraham.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Abraham.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He answered,<BR>&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Take
your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love,<BR>and go to the land
of Moriah.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Offer him
there as a burnt offering<BR>on one of the mountains that I will show
you.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had given him this son. I had
promised that through Isaac his offspring would be called. Now I
asked him to put Isaac and the promise back into My hands.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Early the next morning, Abraham got
up. He saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him, and
his son Isaac. He cut the wood for the burnt offering and set out for
the place I had told him about.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">On the third day Abraham looked up
and saw the place in the distance.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to his young men,<BR>&ldquo;Stay
here with the donkey.<BR>I and the boy will go over there and
worship,<BR>and we will come back to you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke faith even while he carried
the command to sacrifice: &ldquo;we will come back.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham took the wood for the burnt
offering and laid it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire
and the knife, and the two of them walked on together.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac spoke to his father Abraham
and said,<BR>&ldquo;My father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham replied,<BR>&ldquo;Here I
am, my son.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said,<BR>&ldquo;Behold, the
fire and the wood;<BR>but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham answered,<BR>&ldquo;God
Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the two of them walked on
together.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They came to the place I had shown
him. There Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He
bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Abraham reached out his hand
and took the knife to slaughter his son.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At that moment I spoke.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My angel called to him from heaven

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He answered,<BR>&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham lifted up his eyes and
looked, and there behind him was a ram caught by its horns in a
thicket. I had already provided what he had told his son I would
provide.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham went and took the ram and
offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham called the name of that
place &ldquo;The LORD Will Provide.&rdquo; It is said to this day,
&ldquo;On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My angel called to Abraham a second

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I confirmed what I had already

he feared Me more than loss, more than pain, more than the future he

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham returned to his young men,

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah lived to be 127 years old. Her
years were full and hard-won&mdash;years of wandering, doubting,
laughing, and finally holding the promised child.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is,
Hebron) in the land of Canaan. There Abraham mourned for her and wept
over her. The woman who had walked with him through deserts and
promises was gone.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After his tears, Abraham rose from
beside his dead and went to speak to the Hittites, the people of the
land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;I am a foreigner
and a temporary resident among you.<BR>Sell me property for a burial
place among you,<BR>that I may bury my dead out of my sight.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The Hittites answered Abraham with
respect. They said,<BR>&ldquo;Hear us, my lord; you are a mighty
prince among us.<BR>Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.<BR>None
of us will withhold from you his tomb<BR>to hinder you from burying
your dead.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They were willing to lend him honor,
but Abraham wanted more than borrowed space. He wanted to legally his
own piece of the land I had promised him, even if it was only a
burial plot.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham rose and bowed before the
people of the land, the Hittites. He said to them,<BR>&ldquo;If you
are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight,<BR>hear me
and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zohar,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;that he may give me the cave
of Machpelah,<BR>which he owns,<BR>at the end of his field.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Let him give it to me in your
presence<BR>for the full price<BR>as a burial property.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Ephron the Hittite was sitting among
them. In the hearing of all who went in at the gate of his city,
Ephron answered Abraham:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;No, my lord, listen to me:<BR>I
give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it.<BR>In the
sight of the sons of my people I give it to you.<BR>Bury your dead.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke generously, using the
language of a gift, but both men knew that formal transfer required a
public price and agreement. Abraham would not let Sarah&rsquo;s
resting place rest on favors or unclear terms.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham bowed down before the people
of the land. He said to Ephron in the hearing of the people:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;But if you will hear me,<BR>I
give the price of the field.<BR>Accept it from me,<BR>that I may bury
my dead there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Ephron answered Abraham,<BR>&ldquo;My
lord, listen to me:<BR>a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of
silver&mdash;<BR>what is that between me and you?<BR>Bury your dead.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He named the price in a casual way,
but the amount was real and significant. Abraham did not haggle.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham agreed to Ephron&rsquo;s
terms. He weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had mentioned in
the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver,
according to the standard merchant&rsquo;s weight.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the field of Ephron in Machpelah,
which was east of Mamre&mdash;the field with the cave that was in it
and all the trees within its borders&mdash;was deeded to Abraham as
his property in the presence of the Hittites, all who entered the
gate of his city.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After this, Abraham buried Sarah his
wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre (that is,
Hebron) in the land of Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The field and the cave that are in
it were legally established to Abraham as a burial property from the

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The first piece of the promised land

rested in the land I had sworn to give him and his descendants
forever.<BR>What began as a burial place would become the family
tomb, a quiet anchor of My promise in Canaan&rsquo;s soil.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5>Genesis 24 &ndash; The Well, The Camels, And
A Woman Who Said &ldquo;I Will Go&rdquo;</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham was old, advanced in years,
and I had blessed him in everything.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He called the oldest servant of his
household, the one who managed all he owned, and said to him,<BR>&ldquo;Put
your hand under my thigh, that I may make you swear by the LORD, the
God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for
my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live, but
will go to my country and to my kindred and take a wife for my son
Isaac.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The servant said,<BR>&ldquo;Perhaps
the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then
take your son back to the land from which you came?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham replied,<BR>&ldquo;See to it
that you do not take my son back there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The LORD, the God of heaven,
who took me from my father&rsquo;s house and from the land of my
birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, &lsquo;To your offspring
I will give this land&rsquo;&mdash;He will send His angel before you,
and you shall take a wife for my son from there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;But if the woman is not
willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine;
only do not take my son back there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the servant placed his hand under
Abraham&rsquo;s thigh and swore to him concerning this matter.
Abraham trusted Me to guide the journey; his servant trusted
Abraham&rsquo;s word about Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The servant took ten of his master&rsquo;s
camels and all kinds of choice gifts from his master. He arose and
went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor. He made the camels kneel
down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time
when women go out to draw water.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There, he prayed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;O LORD, God of my
master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love
to my master Abraham.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Behold, I am standing by the
spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming
out to draw water.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Let the young woman to whom I
shall say, &lsquo;Please let down your jar that I may drink,&rsquo;
and who shall say, &lsquo;Drink, and I will water your camels
also&rsquo;&mdash;let her be the one whom You have appointed for Your
servant Isaac.<BR>By this I shall know that You have shown steadfast
love to my master.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He asked for more than a sign; he
asked for a woman whose character showed itself in humble, generous
work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before he had finished speaking in
his heart, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder. She
was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor,
Abraham&rsquo;s brother. The young woman was very beautiful, a
virgin; no man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her
jar, and came up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The servant ran to meet her and
said,<BR>&ldquo;Please let me drink a little water from your jar.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said,<BR>&ldquo;Drink, my
lord,&rdquo;<BR>and quickly let down her jar on her hand and gave him
a drink.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When she had finished giving him a
drink, she said,<BR>&ldquo;I will draw water for your camels also,
until they have finished drinking.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She hurried and emptied her jar into
the trough, then ran again and again to the well to draw water, and
she drew for all his camels. The servant watched her in silence,
wondering whether I had made his journey succeed or not. Ten thirsty
camels drink much; her kindness was costly.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the camels had finished
drinking, the man took a gold nose ring and two gold bracelets for
her wrists. He said,<BR>&ldquo;Please tell me whose daughter you are.
Is there room in your father&rsquo;s house for us to lodge?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said,<BR>&ldquo;I am the
daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.&rdquo;<BR>She
added,<BR>&ldquo;We have plenty of straw and fodder, and room to
lodge.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the man bowed his head and
worshiped Me there at the well.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,<BR>&ldquo;Blessed be the
LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His
steadfast love and His faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the
LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master&rsquo;s
relatives.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah ran and told her mother&rsquo;s
household these things.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Her brother Laban, seeing the ring
and the bracelets on his sister&rsquo;s arms and hearing her words,
ran out to the man at the spring. He found him standing by the camels
and said,<BR>&ldquo;Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand
outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man came into the house. Laban
unloaded the camels, gave straw and fodder for them, and water to
wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. Food was set
before him to eat, but he said,<BR>&ldquo;I will not eat until I have
said what I have to say.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said,<BR>&ldquo;Speak on.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the servant told the story
plainly: Abraham&rsquo;s wealth, the birth of Isaac, the oath not to
take a wife from the Canaanites, his prayer at the well, and how
Rebekah had answered it exactly. He ended:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Now then, if you are going to
show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if
not, tell me, that I may turn to the right or to the left.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban and Bethuel answered,<BR>&ldquo;This
matter has come from the LORD;<BR>we cannot speak to you bad or good.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Behold, Rebekah is before
you;<BR>take her and go,<BR>and let her be the wife of your master&rsquo;s
son,<BR>as the LORD has spoken.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Abraham&rsquo;s servant heard
their words, he bowed himself to the ground before Me. Then he
brought out silver and gold jewelry and garments and gave them to
Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her
mother.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They ate and drank, he and the men
who were with him, and they spent the night there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the morning he said,<BR>&ldquo;Send
me back to my master.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Her brother and her mother
said,<BR>&ldquo;Let the young woman remain with us a few days&mdash;at
least ten; after that she may go.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to them,<BR>&ldquo;Do not
delay me, since the LORD has made my journey succeed. Send me away
that I may go to my master.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said,<BR>&ldquo;We will call
the young woman and ask her.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They called Rebekah and said to
her,<BR>&ldquo;Will you go with this man?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said,<BR>&ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She stepped into My plan with a
simple, decisive yes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So they sent away their sister
Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham&rsquo;s servant and his men. They
blessed Rebekah and said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Our sister,<BR>may you become
thousands of ten thousands,<BR>and may your offspring possess<BR>the
gate of those who hate them.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah and her young women arose
and mounted the camels and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah
and went his way.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Meanwhile, Isaac had come from
Beer-lahai-roi and was living in the Negev. One evening he went out
into the field to meditate. He lifted up his eyes and saw, and
behold, camels were coming.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when
she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel and said to the
servant,<BR>&ldquo;Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The servant said,<BR>&ldquo;It is my
master.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So she took her veil and covered
herself.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The servant told Isaac all the
things that he had done&mdash;how I had led each step and answered
his prayer. Then Isaac brought Rebekah into the tent of Sarah his
mother and took her as his wife. He loved her, and Isaac was
comforted after his mother&rsquo;s death.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had guided the journey, the
prayer, the girl at the well, the family&rsquo;s consent, and her
choice.<BR>Without visions or fire, just through providence,
character, and courage, I joined Isaac and Rebekah&mdash;<BR>and My
promise moved quietly on to the next generation.</P>

</P>
<P><B><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5>Genesis 25 &ndash; New Wives, Old
Promises, And A Despised Birthright</FONT></STRONG></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After Sarah&rsquo;s death, Abraham
took another wife, Keturah. She bore him more sons: Zimran, Jokshan,
Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan;
Midian&rsquo;s sons became clans of their own. From Abraham&rsquo;s
body, many lines were spreading out across the east.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Abraham knew where My covenant
rested.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham gave all that he had to
Isaac.<BR>To the sons of his concubines he gave gifts and sent them
away from his son Isaac, eastward, to the land of the east. The
promise would not be shared; it would pass through one line, though I
would still watch over the others.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abraham lived 175 years.<BR>Then
Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and
full of years, and was gathered to his people.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac and Ishmael, the two sons
whose stories had once competed in Sarah&rsquo;s tent, came together
to bury him. They buried Abraham in the cave of Machpelah, in the
field that was before Mamre, the same field Abraham had purchased
from Ephron the Hittite&mdash;where Sarah was buried. The family tomb
now held both father and mother of the covenant family.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After Abraham&rsquo;s death, I
blessed his son Isaac. Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi&mdash;the
well where I had once seen Hagar in her distress.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These are the generations of
Ishmael, Abraham&rsquo;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian bore to
Abraham. Twelve sons were born to him&mdash;Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel,
Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and
Kedemah&mdash;twelve princes according to their tribes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Ishmael lived 137 years, then died
and was gathered to his people. His descendants lived from Havilah to
Shur, near Egypt, in the direction of Assyria. He settled over
against all his relatives, just as I had said he would.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the focus returned to the
covenant line.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These are the generations of Isaac,
Abraham&rsquo;s son.<BR>Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac was forty
years old when he took Rebekah as his wife&mdash;the daughter of
Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah was barren. Again, the
promised line met a closed womb.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac prayed earnestly to Me for his
wife, and I heard him. I granted his plea, and Rebekah conceived.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But the children struggled together
within her. It was not ordinary movement; it was war in miniature.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said,<BR>&ldquo;If it is to be
this way, why is this happening to me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She went to inquire of Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I answered her,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Two
nations are in your womb,<BR>and two peoples from within you shall be
separated;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">one shall be
stronger than the other,<BR>and the older shall serve the younger.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before they were born, before they
had done right or wrong, I declared My purposes: the younger would
carry the line of promise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When her days to give birth were
completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The first came out red, all his body
like a hairy cloak; they named him Esau. Afterward his brother came
out, with his hand grasping Esau&rsquo;s heel; they named him Jacob
(&ldquo;he grasps the heel,&rdquo; hinting at struggle and
supplanting). Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The boys grew.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau became a skillful hunter, a man
of the open country.<BR>Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling among the
tents.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac loved Esau, because he enjoyed
the taste of wild game.<BR>Rebekah loved Jacob. Divided affections in
the parents would soon deepen the conflict between the sons.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">One day, Jacob was cooking stew.
Esau came in from the field, exhausted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau said to Jacob,<BR>&ldquo;Let me
eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted.&rdquo;<BR>(That is why
he was also called Edom&mdash;&ldquo;Red.&rdquo;)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said,<BR>&ldquo;Sell me your
birthright now.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau said,<BR>&ldquo;Look, I am
about to die;<BR>of what use is a birthright to me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said,<BR>&ldquo;Swear to me
now.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Esau swore to him and sold his
birthright to Jacob.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and
lentil stew. He ate and drank and rose and went his way.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Thus Esau despised his birthright.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He traded the firstborn&rsquo;s
inheritance&mdash;place, promise, and future&mdash;for one meal.
Jacob&rsquo;s grasping and Esau&rsquo;s carelessness would shape the
next chapters of this family&rsquo;s story.<BR>My choice of the
younger did not excuse their sins, but My purpose would move forward
even through their flawed desires.</P>
<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5>Genesis 26 &ndash;
Famine, Old Fears, New Wells, And A Quiet Oath</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There was a famine in the
land&mdash;besides the earlier famine in Abraham&rsquo;s days. Isaac
faced the same kind of scarcity his father had known.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac went to Abimelech king of the
Philistines in Gerar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I appeared to Isaac and said,<BR><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Do
not go down to Egypt.<BR>Dwell in the land that I shall tell you.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Sojourn
in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you,<BR>for to
you and to your offspring I will give all these lands,<BR>and I will
establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I will
multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven<BR>and will give to
your offspring all these lands.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;And in
your offspring<BR>all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">because
Abraham obeyed My voice<BR>and kept My charge, My commandments, My
statutes, and My laws.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Isaac stayed in Gerar. I bound My
promise to Abraham now openly to Isaac: same land, same blessing,
same mission for the nations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But fear still lived in him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the men of the place asked
about his wife, he said, &ldquo;She is my sister,&rdquo; because he
thought, &ldquo;If I say, &lsquo;She is my wife,&rsquo; they will
kill me because of Rebekah,&rdquo; for she was beautiful.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He walked the same crooked path his
father had walked.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He lived there a long time. One day
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw
Isaac caressing Rebekah his wife. Then Abimelech called Isaac and
said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Behold, she is your wife.<BR>How
then could you say, &lsquo;She is my sister&rsquo;?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said to him,<BR>&ldquo;Because
I thought, &lsquo;Lest I die because of her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Abimelech said,<BR>&ldquo;What is
this you have done to us?<BR>One of the people might easily have lain
with your wife,<BR>and you would have brought guilt upon us.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Abimelech warned all the people,
saying,<BR>&ldquo;Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely
be put to death.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Even in Isaac&rsquo;s fear and
deceit, I used a foreign king to protect My chosen line.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac sowed in that land and reaped
in the same year a hundredfold. I blessed him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man became rich, and gained more
and more until he became very wealthy. He had flocks and herds and
many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They stopped up and filled with
earth all the wells that his father&rsquo;s servants had dug in the
days of Abraham. Abimelech said to Isaac,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Go away from us,<BR>for you
are much mightier than we.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac departed from there and camped
in the valley of Gerar and lived there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac dug again the wells of water
that had been dug in Abraham&rsquo;s days, which the Philistines had
stopped after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his
father had given them. He was literally and symbolically reopening
his father&rsquo;s work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But when Isaac&rsquo;s servants dug
in the valley and found there a spring of flowing water, the herdsmen
of Gerar quarreled with Isaac&rsquo;s herdsmen, saying,<BR>&ldquo;The
water is ours.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he named the well Esek
(&ldquo;Contention&rdquo;), because they contended with him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They dug another well, and they
quarreled over that also. He named it Sitnah (&ldquo;Opposition&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Enmity&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac moved from there and dug
another well, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth
(&ldquo;Room&rdquo;), saying,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;For now the LORD has made
room for us,<BR>and we shall be fruitful in the land.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He did not win by force; he yielded
ground until I gave him space.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From there he went up to Beersheba.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">That same night I appeared to him
and said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I am
the God of Abraham your father.<BR>Do not be afraid, for I am with
you.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I will
bless you<BR>and multiply your offspring<BR>for My servant Abraham&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he built an altar there and
called on My name. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a
well. Altars and wells&mdash;worship and water&mdash;marked the
places where My promise settled.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Abimelech came to him from
Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said to them,<BR>&ldquo;Why
have you come to me,<BR>seeing that you hate me and have sent me away
from you?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said,<BR>&ldquo;We see plainly
that the LORD has been with you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;So we said,<BR>let there be a
sworn pact between us,<BR>between you and us,<BR>and let us make a
covenant with you,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;that you will do us no
harm,<BR>just as we have not touched you<BR>and have done to you
nothing but good<BR>and have sent you away in peace.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;You are now the blessed of
the LORD.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac prepared a feast, and they ate
and drank. They rose early in the morning and exchanged oaths. Isaac
sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">That same day Isaac&rsquo;s servants
came and told him about the well that they had dug. They said to
him,<BR>&ldquo;We have found water.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He called it Shibah (&ldquo;Oath&rdquo;).
Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba (&ldquo;Well of the
Oath&rdquo;) to this day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My promise to Abraham had been
sealed at Beersheba with Abraham and Abimelech; now again, with Isaac
and another Abimelech, peace and water were tied to My name in that
place.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Esau was forty years old, he
took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the
daughter of Elon the Hittite, as wives. They made life bitter for
Isaac and Rebekah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau cared little for the covenant
line or its holiness. His marriages to Hittite women foreshadowed
more grief and more division to come.</P>

such as I love,<BR>and bring it to me so that I may eat,<BR>that my
soul may bless you before I die.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac intended to pass on the
patriarchal blessing to Esau, the firstborn, even though I had told
Rebekah, &ldquo;the older shall serve the younger.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke
to Esau. When Esau went to the field to hunt game, she turned to
Jacob.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said to her younger son,<BR>&ldquo;Look,
I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&lsquo;Bring me game and prepare
savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD
before I die.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Now therefore, my son, obey
my voice as I command you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Go to the flock and bring me
two good young goats,<BR>so that I may prepare from them savory food
for your father, such as he loves.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;And you shall bring it to
your father to eat,<BR>so that he may bless you before he dies.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said to Rebekah,<BR>&ldquo;Behold,
my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Perhaps my father will feel
me, and I shall seem to be mocking him,<BR>and I shall bring a curse
upon myself and not a blessing.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His concern was not truth, but the
risk of being caught.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah said,<BR>&ldquo;Let your
curse be on me, my son;<BR>only obey my voice, and go, bring them to
me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he went and took the goats and
brought them to his mother. She prepared savory food, such as Isaac
loved.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah took the best garments of
Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on
Jacob, her younger son. She covered his hands and the smooth part of
his neck with the skins of the young goats, and she put the food and
the bread she had prepared into Jacob&rsquo;s hand.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Jacob went in to his father and
said, &ldquo;My father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac answered, &ldquo;Here I am.
Who are you, my son?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said to his father, &ldquo;I
am Esau your firstborn.<BR>I have done as you told me; now sit up and
eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said, &ldquo;How is it that
you have found it so quickly, my son?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;Because the LORD
your God granted me success.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He pulled My name into his lie.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said, &ldquo;Please come near,
that I may feel you, my son,<BR>to know whether you are really my son
Esau or not.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob went near. Isaac felt him and
said, &ldquo;The voice is Jacob&rsquo;s voice,<BR>but the hands are
the hands of Esau.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He did not recognize him, because
Jacob&rsquo;s hands were hairy like Esau&rsquo;s hands.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he blessed him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;Are you really my
son Esau?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob answered, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said, &ldquo;Bring it near to
me, that I may eat of my son&rsquo;s game and bless you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Jacob brought it near, and he
ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Isaac said, &ldquo;Come near
and kiss me, my son.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob came near and kissed him.
Isaac smelled the smell of Esau&rsquo;s garments and blessed him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;See, the smell of my son<BR>is
as the smell of a field<BR>that the LORD has blessed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;May God give you<BR>of the
dew of heaven<BR>and of the fatness of the earth<BR>and plenty of
grain and wine.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Let peoples serve you,<BR>and
nations bow down to you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Be lord over your
brothers,<BR>and may your mother&rsquo;s sons bow down to you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Cursed be everyone who curses
you,<BR>and blessed be everyone who blesses you!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The covenant blessing that had been
with Abraham and Isaac now rested on Jacob&mdash;delivered through
deceit, but still effective. I would discipline the deceiver, yet I
would not revoke what I had purposed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As soon as Isaac had finished
blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of
his father, Esau came in from his hunting.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He also prepared savory food and
brought it to his father. He said,<BR>&ldquo;Let my father arise and
eat of his son&rsquo;s game, that you may bless me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He answered, &ldquo;I am your son,
your firstborn, Esau.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Isaac trembled violently and
said, &ldquo;Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me,
and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him?<BR>Yes, and
he shall be blessed.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Esau heard his father&rsquo;s
words, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and
said,<BR>&ldquo;Bless me, even me also, O my father!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac said, &ldquo;Your brother came
deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau said, &ldquo;Is he not rightly
named Jacob (He Grabs the Heel)?<BR>For he has cheated me these two
times.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;He took away my birthright,
and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;Have you not
reserved a blessing for me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac answered Esau, &ldquo;Behold,
I have made him lord over you,<BR>and all his brothers I have given
to him for servants,<BR>and with grain and wine I have sustained him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What then can I do for you,
my son?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau said, &ldquo;Have you but one
blessing, my father?<BR>Bless me, even me also, O my father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac his father answered and said
to him: &ldquo;Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your
dwelling be,<BR>and away from the dew of heaven on high.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;By your sword you shall live,
and you shall serve your brother;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">but when you grow restless,<BR>you
shall break his yoke from your neck.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The struggle in Rebekah&rsquo;s womb
had now become open conflict in the house.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing with which his father had blessed him. Esau said in his
heart,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The days of mourning for my
father are near;<BR>then I will kill my brother Jacob.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah was told what Esau had said.
She sent and called Jacob and said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Behold, your brother Esau
comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Now therefore, my son, obey
my voice.<BR>Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;and stay with him a
while,<BR>until your brother&rsquo;s fury turns away&mdash;<BR>until
your brother&rsquo;s anger turns away from you and he forgets what
you have done to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Then I will send and bring
you from there.<BR>Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rebekah then spoke to Isaac with
another motive on her lips and the same motive in her heart.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said to Isaac,<BR>&ldquo;I am
disgusted with my life because of the Hittite women.<BR>If Jacob
marries one of the Hittite women like these,<BR>one of the women of
the land,<BR>what good will my life be to me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Her complaint about Esau&rsquo;s
wives prepared the way for Isaac to send Jacob away to find a wife
among his own kin. Through deceit and family tension, I would still
move Jacob onto the path where I intended to meet him and shape him.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 28 &ndash; A Runaway, A Ladder, And A
Promise In The Dark</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac called Jacob and blessed him
again. He commanded him and said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;You shall not take a wife
from the daughters of Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to
the house of Bethuel your mother&rsquo;s father,<BR>and take as your
wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother&rsquo;s
brother.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;May God Almighty bless you
and make you fruitful and multiply you,<BR>that you may become a
company of peoples.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;May He give the blessing of
Abraham to you<BR>and to your offspring with you,<BR>that you may
take possession of the land of your sojournings<BR>that God gave to
Abraham.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac intentionally passed Abraham&rsquo;s
blessing to Jacob&mdash;the land, the fruitfulness, and the role in
blessing the nations. What Jacob had taken by deceit, Isaac now
confirmed by choice.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Isaac sent Jacob away. Jacob went
to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of
Rebekah, Jacob and Esau&rsquo;s mother.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau saw that Isaac had blessed
Jacob and sent him away to find a wife from Paddan-aram, and that as
he blessed him he had charged him, &ldquo;You must not take a wife
from the daughters of Canaan,&rdquo; and that Jacob had obeyed his
father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Esau realized that the daughters
of Canaan displeased his father Isaac. Trying to fix things in his
own way, Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of
Ishmael son of Abraham and sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife, in
addition to the wives he already had.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He tried to move closer to Abraham&rsquo;s
line, but he did not ask Me or change his heart. His marriages
remained a source of trouble.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob left Beersheba and set out for
Haran. Alone now, leaving home because of his brother&rsquo;s anger
and his mother&rsquo;s plan, he walked into uncertainty with only the
blessing and My unseen presence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He came to a certain place and
stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. He took one of
the stones of that place and put it under his head and lay down to
sleep.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He dreamed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the dream he saw a stairway set
up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. My angels were
going up and down on it&mdash;moving between My realm and his,
carrying out My purposes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I stood above it and spoke.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I am
the LORD,<BR>the God of Abraham your father<BR>and the God of Isaac.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;The
land on which you lie<BR>I will give to you and to your offspring.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Your
offspring shall be like the dust of the earth,<BR>and you shall

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;and in
you and in your offspring<BR>shall all the families of the earth be
blessed.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Behold,
I am with you<BR>and will keep you wherever you go,<BR>and will bring
you back to this land.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;For I
will not leave you<BR>until I have done<BR>what I have promised you.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob had left his father&rsquo;s
tent with a stolen blessing and a guilty history. I met him in the
open night and gave him My own direct word: the Abrahamic promise was
now his, and so was My personal presence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob woke from his sleep and
said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Surely the LORD is in this
place,<BR>and I did not know it.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was afraid and said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;How awesome is this
place!<BR>This is none other than the house of God,<BR>and this is
the gate of heaven.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Early in the morning Jacob took the
stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a pillar, and
poured oil on top of it. He marked the place as meeting ground
between heaven and earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He called the name of that place
Bethel (&ldquo;House of God&rdquo;), though the city&rsquo;s former
name had been Luz.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob made a vow:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If God will be with me<BR>and
will keep me in this way that I go,<BR>and will give me bread to eat
and clothing to wear,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;so that I come again to my
father&rsquo;s house in peace,<BR>then the LORD shall be my God,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;and this stone, which I have
set up as a pillar,<BR>shall be God&rsquo;s house.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;And of all that You give me<BR>I
will surely give a tenth to You.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was not yet a fully changed man.
His vow still had conditions&mdash;&ldquo;If You will be with
me&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;but the direction of his life had shifted.
Alone, on hard ground with a stone for a pillow, <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Jacob
discovered that I was not just the God of Abraham and Isaac. I was
also the God who would go with him into exile, guard him there, and
bring him home.</SPAN></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 29 &ndash; Love At The Well, A Switch

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob went on his journey and came
to the land of the people of the east.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He looked and saw a well in the
field. There were three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of
that well the flocks were watered. A large stone covered the mouth of
the well. When all the flocks were gathered, the shepherds would roll
the stone away, water the sheep, and then put the stone back in its
place.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said to them, &ldquo;My
brothers, where are you from?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said, &ldquo;We are from
Haran.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;Do you know Laban
the son of Nahor?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said, &ldquo;We know him.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;Is it well with
him?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said, &ldquo;It is well; and
see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said, &ldquo;Behold, it is
still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered.
Water the sheep and go, pasture them.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But they said, &ldquo;We cannot
until all the flocks are gathered and they roll the stone from the
well&rsquo;s mouth; then we water the sheep.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">While he was still speaking with
them, Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep, for she was a
shepherdess.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter
of Laban his mother&rsquo;s brother, and the sheep of Laban, Jacob
went over and rolled the stone from the well&rsquo;s mouth and
watered the flock of Laban. Strength and eagerness met at that stone.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted
up his voice and wept. He told Rachel that he was a relative of her
father, that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son. She ran and told her father.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As soon as Laban heard the news
about Jacob, his sister&rsquo;s son, he ran to meet him, embraced
him, kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all
these things.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said, &ldquo;Surely you are my
bone and my flesh.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob stayed with him a month.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Laban said to Jacob, &ldquo;Because
you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell
me, what shall your wages be?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Now Laban had two daughters.<BR>The
name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Leah&rsquo;s eyes were delicate, but
Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. Jacob loved Rachel.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;I will serve you
seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said, &ldquo;It is better that
I give her to you than that I should give her to another man; stay
with me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Jacob served seven years for
Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he
had for her.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob said to Laban, &ldquo;Give
me my wife, that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban gathered all the men of the
place and made a feast.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But in the evening he took his
daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her.
(Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her
servant.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the morning&mdash;behold, it was
Leah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said to Laban,<BR>&ldquo;What
is this you have done to me?<BR>Did I not serve with you for
Rachel?<BR>Why then have you deceived me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said,<BR>&ldquo;It is not so
done in our country,<BR>to give the younger before the firstborn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Complete the week of this
one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me
another seven years.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob did so, and completed Leah&rsquo;s
bridal week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.
(Laban gave his maid Bilhah to Rachel as her servant.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob went in also to Rachel, and he
loved Rachel more than Leah. He served Laban for another seven years.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I saw Leah was unloved. So I opened
her womb; but Rachel was barren.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Leah conceived and bore a son, and
she called his name Reuben, for she said,<BR>&ldquo;Because the LORD
has looked upon my affliction;<BR>for now my husband will love me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She conceived again and bore a son,
and said,<BR>&ldquo;Because the LORD has heard that I am hated,<BR>He
has given me this son also.&rdquo;<BR>And she called his name Simeon.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Again she conceived and bore a son,
and said,<BR>&ldquo;Now this time my husband will be attached to
me,<BR>because I have borne him three sons.&rdquo;<BR>Therefore his
name was called Levi.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She conceived again and bore a son,
and said,<BR>&ldquo;This time I will praise the LORD.&rdquo;<BR>Therefore
she called his name Judah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then she stopped bearing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In a house twisted by deceit and
favoritism, I saw the pain of the unloved wife and began My royal
line through her fourth son&mdash;Judah.<BR>Jacob had chased love and
been deceived; Leah had chased her husband&rsquo;s affection and
found disappointment; yet in the middle of it I quietly advanced My
promise.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob
no children, she envied her sister.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said to Jacob, &ldquo;Give me
children, or I die!&rdquo;</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob&rsquo;s anger was
kindled against Rachel. He said,<BR>&ldquo;Am I in the place of
God,<BR>who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rachel turned to human solutions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said, &ldquo;Here is my servant
Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and even I may
have children through her.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So she gave Bilhah her servant as a
wife, and Jacob went in to her.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a
son. Rachel said,<BR>&ldquo;God has judged me, and has also heard my
voice and given me a son.&rdquo;<BR>Therefore she called his name Dan
(&ldquo;He has judged&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Bilhah conceived again and bore
Jacob a second son. Rachel said,<BR>&ldquo;With mighty wrestlings I
have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed.&rdquo;<BR>So she
called his name Naphtali (&ldquo;My wrestlings&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Seeing the contest, Leah also turned
to surrogate schemes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Leah saw that she had ceased
bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob
as a wife. Zilpah bore Jacob a son. Leah said,<BR>&ldquo;Good fortune
has come!&rdquo;<BR>So she called his name Gad (&ldquo;Good
fortune&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. Leah
said,<BR>&ldquo;Happy am I! For women have called me happy.&rdquo;<BR>So
she called his name Asher (&ldquo;Happy&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The household became a tangle of
rivalry, surrogates, and children counted as points in a contest.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the days of wheat harvest, Reuben
went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother
Leah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Rachel said to Leah,<BR>&ldquo;Please
give me some of your son&rsquo;s mandrakes.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Leah said,<BR>&ldquo;Is it a
small thing that you have taken away my husband?<BR>Would you take
away my son&rsquo;s mandrakes also?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rachel said,<BR>&ldquo;Then he may
lie with you tonight in exchange for your son&rsquo;s mandrakes.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So when Jacob came from the field in
the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said,<BR>&ldquo;You must
come in to me, for I have hired you with my son&rsquo;s mandrakes.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he lay with her that night.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I listened to Leah. She conceived
and bore Jacob a fifth son. Leah said,<BR>&ldquo;God has given me my
wages because I gave my servant to my husband.&rdquo;<BR>So she
called his name Issachar (&ldquo;Wages&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Leah conceived again and bore Jacob
a sixth son. Leah said,<BR>&ldquo;God has endowed me with a good
endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six
sons.&rdquo;<BR>So she called his name Zebulun (&ldquo;Honor&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Afterward she bore a daughter and
called her name Dinah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">For years Rachel remained barren,
watching her sister bear son after son.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I remembered Rachel, and I
listened to her and opened her womb. She conceived and bore a son and
said,<BR>&ldquo;God has taken away my reproach.&rdquo;<BR>She called
his name Joseph (&ldquo;May He add&rdquo;), saying,<BR>&ldquo;May the
LORD add to me another son.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the middle of jealousy and
bargaining, I quietly removed her shame and began a new chapter
through Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob
said to Laban,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Send me away, that I may go
to my own home and country.<BR>Give me my wives and my children for
whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that
I have given you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said to him,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If I have found favor in your
sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me
because of you.<BR>Name your wages, and I will give it.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said, &ldquo;You yourself know
how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.<BR>For
you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and
the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But now, when shall I provide for my
own household also?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said, &ldquo;What shall I give
you?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said, &ldquo;You shall not
give me anything.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">If you will do this for me, I will
again pasture your flock and keep it:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Let me pass through all your flock
today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every
black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they
shall be my wages.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So my honesty will answer for me
later, when you come to look into my wages with you: every goat that
is not speckled and spotted and every lamb that is not black shall be
counted stolen.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said,<BR>&ldquo;Good! Let it
be as you have said.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But that very day Laban went ahead
of him and removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and
all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that
had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in the
charge of his sons. He set a distance of three days&rsquo; journey
between himself and Jacob, while Jacob pastured the rest of Laban&rsquo;s
flock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban tried to rig the terms in his
favor.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob took fresh sticks of
poplar and almond and plane trees and peeled white streaks in them,
exposing the white of the sticks. He set the peeled sticks in front
of the flocks in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to
drink, and where they bred.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The flocks bred in front of the
sticks and so brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted young.
Jacob separated the young animals, setting the faces of the flocks
toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He kept
his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban&rsquo;s flock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Whenever the stronger animals were
breeding, Jacob would set the sticks before their eyes at the
troughs, so that they might breed among the sticks; but when the
weaker animals were breeding, he would not set them there. So the
weaker were Laban&rsquo;s, and the stronger Jacob&rsquo;s.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Thus the man increased greatly and
had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban schemed; Jacob schemed in
return. Yet underneath both men&rsquo;s tricks, I was the One who
gave children to barren women and increase to flocks, moving My
covenant family toward the future I had promised.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 31 &ndash; God Of Bethel, Stolen

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob heard the words of Laban&rsquo;s
sons, who were saying,<BR>&ldquo;Jacob has taken all that was our
father&rsquo;s,<BR>and from what was our father&rsquo;s he has gained
all this wealth.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob saw that Laban&rsquo;s face
was not toward him as before. The favor that had once covered him in
that house was gone.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I said to Jacob, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Return
to the land of your fathers and to your kindred,<BR>and I will be
with you.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob sent and called Rachel and
Leah to the field where his flock was.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to them,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I see that your father&rsquo;s
face is not toward me as before,<BR>but the God of my father has been
with me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;You know that I have served
your father with all my strength,<BR>yet your father has cheated me
and changed my wages ten times.<BR>But God did not permit him to harm
me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If he said, &lsquo;The
speckled shall be your wages,&rsquo;<BR>then all the flock bore
speckled;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">and if he said, &lsquo;The striped
shall be your wages,&rsquo;<BR>then all the flock bore striped.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Thus God has taken away the
livestock of your father<BR>and given them to me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;In the breeding season of the
flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream<BR>that the male goats
that mated with the flock were striped, speckled, and mottled.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Then the angel of God said to
me in the dream, &lsquo;Jacob,&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;Here I am!&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;And He said, &lsquo;Lift up
your eyes and see&hellip; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to
you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I am the God of Bethel, where
you anointed a pillar and made a vow to Me.<BR>Now arise, go out from
this land, and return to the land of your kindred.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Rachel and Leah answered him,
&ldquo;Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father&rsquo;s
house?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Are we not regarded by him as
foreigners?<BR>For he has sold us, and has indeed devoured our money.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;All the wealth that God has
taken away from our father<BR>belongs to us and to our children.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Now then, whatever God has
said to you, do.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They knew their father&rsquo;s
greed; they sided with Jacob and with My word.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Jacob arose and set his sons and
his wives on camels. He drove away all his livestock, all his
property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he
had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of
Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban had gone to shear his sheep.
While he was gone, Rachel stole her father&rsquo;s household gods.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by
not telling him that he intended to flee. He fled with all that he
had. He arose and crossed the Euphrates and set his face toward the
hill country of Gilead.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">On the third day, Laban was told
that Jacob had fled. He took his kinsmen with him and pursued Jacob
for seven days, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But I came to Laban the Aramean in a
dream by night and said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Take care that you speak to
Jacob<BR>neither good nor bad.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I put a boundary on Laban&rsquo;s
anger.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban overtook Jacob. Jacob had
pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen
pitched theirs in the hill country of Gilead.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said to Jacob,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What have you done, that you
have tricked me<BR>and driven away my daughters like captives of the
sword?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Why did you flee secretly and
trick me,<BR>and did not tell me,<BR>so that I might have sent you
away with mirth and songs,<BR>with tambourine and lyre?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;And you did not permit me to
kiss my sons and my daughters farewell.<BR>Now you have done
foolishly.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;It is in my power to do you
harm,<BR>but the God of your father spoke to me last night,
saying,<BR>&lsquo;Take care that you speak to Jacob neither good nor
bad.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;And now you have gone away
because you longed greatly for your father&rsquo;s house,<BR>but why
did you steal my gods?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob answered Laban,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Because I was afraid,<BR>for
I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;But anyone with whom you find
your gods shall not live.<BR>In the presence of our kinsmen point out
what I have that is yours, and take it.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob did not know that Rachel had
stolen them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Laban went into Jacob&rsquo;s
tent, and into Leah&rsquo;s tent, and into the tent of the two female
servants, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah&rsquo;s
tent and entered Rachel&rsquo;s tent.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Now Rachel had taken the household
gods and put them in the camel&rsquo;s saddle and sat on them. Laban
felt all about the tent, but did not find them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said to her father,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Let not my lord be angry that
I cannot rise before you,<BR>for the way of women is upon me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he searched but did not find the
household gods.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob was angry and argued with
Laban.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What is my offense? What is
my sin,<BR>that you have hotly pursued me?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;For you have felt through all
my goods;<BR>what have you found of all your household goods?<BR>Set
it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen,<BR>that they may decide
between us two.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;These twenty years I have
been with you.<BR>Your ewes and your female goats have not
miscarried,<BR>and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What was torn by wild beasts
I did not bring to you.<BR>I bore the loss myself.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;There I was: by day the heat
consumed me,<BR>and the cold by night,<BR>and my sleep fled from my
eyes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;These twenty years I have
been in your house.<BR>I served you fourteen years for your two
daughters,<BR>and six years for your flock,<BR>and you have changed
my wages ten times.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If the God of my father, the
God of Abraham,<BR>and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my
side,<BR>surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;God saw my affliction and the
labor of my hands<BR>and rebuked you last night.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban answered Jacob,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The daughters are my
daughters,<BR>the children are my children,<BR>the flocks are my
flocks,<BR>and all that you see is mine.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;But what can I do this day
for these my daughters<BR>or for their children whom they have borne?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Come now, let us make a
covenant, you and I.<BR>Let it be a witness between you and me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Jacob took a stone and set it up
as a pillar. Jacob said to his kinsmen,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Gather stones.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They took stones and made a heap,
and they ate there by the heap.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha
(Aramaic),<BR>but Jacob called it Galeed (Hebrew)&mdash;both meaning
&ldquo;heap of witness.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Laban said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;This heap is a witness
between you and me today.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Therefore he named it Galeed, and
also Mizpah (&ldquo;Watchtower&rdquo;), for he said,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The LORD watch between you
and me,<BR>when we are out of one another&rsquo;s sight.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If you oppress my
daughters,<BR>or if you take wives besides my daughters,<BR>although
no one is with us,<BR>see, God is witness between you and me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Laban said to Jacob,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;See this heap and the pillar
which I have set between you and me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;This heap is a witness, and
the pillar is a witness,<BR>that I will not pass over this heap to
you,<BR>and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me,
for harm.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The God of Abraham and the
God of Nahor,<BR>the God of their father, judge between us.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob swore by the Fear of his
father Isaac.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob offered a sacrifice in the
hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and
spent the night in the hill country.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Early in the morning Laban rose and
kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed
and returned home.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">With a stone, a heap, and an oath, I
drew a line between Jacob and Laban.<BR>Rachel held hidden idols;
Laban clung to gods that could be sat upon.<BR>Jacob still feared and
tangled his way forward.<BR>But I, the God of Bethel and the Fear of
Isaac, guarded My covenant carrier on the road back to Canaan.</P>

of Reckoning: Jacob Wrestles the Promise&quot;</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob moved like a man who knew the
past could hunt him. Word that Esau was coming with four hundred men
filled him with dread. He split his people, flocks, and herds into
two camps&mdash;if Esau attacked one, perhaps the other might escape.
Then he prayed, honest and urgent: God of my father, you promised to
make me many. Rescue me from my brother&rsquo;s hand; you once spoke
to me, and I claimed your promise. Deliver me, and I will worship
you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After that Jacob prepared a plan of
mercy and strategy. He sent messengers ahead with a conciliatory
message to Esau, reminding him of their shared past and calling him
&ldquo;my lord&rdquo; in hope of softening his anger. The messengers
returned with news that Esau was coming&mdash;and he was coming. Fear
drove Jacob to act again. He arranged a tremendous caravan of
livestock into droves, each driven by servants, with instructions:
present these gifts to Esau in a staged approach&mdash;goats first,
then sheep, camels, cattle&mdash;so Esau&rsquo;s heart might be
turned and he might accept Jacob&rsquo;s face.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">That night, as the caravan was sent
on, Jacob remained alone. A man came and wrestled with him until
daybreak. They grappled through the night&mdash;no easy skirmish but
a raw, physical, spiritual contest. When the fellow could not best
Jacob, he touched Jacob&rsquo;s hip and dislocated it. Dawn was
breaking. The stranger asked to be released; Jacob would not let go
unless he blessed him. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; the man
asked. &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No longer Jacob,&rdquo;
the man said, &ldquo;but Israel&mdash;for you have striven with God
and with men and prevailed.&rdquo; Jacob named the place Peniel: &ldquo;I
have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob limped away from the
encounter, marked forever: his hip disabled, his name transformed. He
had come to meet a brother, and through wrestling in the dark he met
God and himself&mdash;changed, burdened, and blessed. At first light
he sent his family and possessions across the ford of the Jabbok, and
went on before them, carrying a new name and a new purpose into the
day.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Dawn broke on the river. Jacob sent his wives,
children, and all he had across the ford, and they went over safely.
He stayed behind alone, walking with a new weight in his step&mdash;his
hip had been wrenched in the night and would ache as a lasting mark.
He called the place Peniel, saying, &ldquo;I have seen God face to
face, and yet my life is preserved.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob crossed over the stream
and continued on his way, limping but carrying the blessing and the
new name he had wrestled for: Israel.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Jacob left the land of his
uncle Laban, I watched him draw near again to the land I had sworn to
give to Abraham and Isaac. He was coming back to Canaan with wives,
children, servants, and great wealth&mdash;but also with a shadow
over his heart: the memory of Esau, the brother he had deceived.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To steady him, I sent my angels to
meet him on the way. When Jacob saw the camp of my messengers, awe
rose inside him.<BR>&ldquo;This is God&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo; he
said.<BR>He named that place <EM>Mahanaim</EM>&mdash;&ldquo;Two
Camps&rdquo;&mdash;for there his weary band stood beside My invisible
army.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But fear still gripped him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as Jacob sent messengers
ahead to his brother Esau, who dwelled in the land of Seir, in the
country of Edom. I heard the words he put in their mouths:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;To my master Esau, from your servant Jacob:<BR>I
have stayed with Laban until now. I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male
and female servants. I send this message to my lord, that I may find
favor in your eyes.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He who once grasped his brother&rsquo;s
heel now bent low, calling himself &ldquo;servant&rdquo; and Esau
&ldquo;lord.&rdquo; Fear has a way of stripping a man of his
arrogance. I allowed that fear, because I intended to reshape him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The messengers returned, and I saw
Jacob&rsquo;s face tighten as they spoke.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;We came to your brother Esau,&rdquo; they
said,<BR>&ldquo;and he is coming to meet you&mdash;with four hundred
men.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I did not need to tell Jacob what
four hundred armed men usually meant. His heart raced; dread crashed
over him like a flood. He imagined slaughter&mdash;his wives, his
children, all that he owned wiped out in one encounter. I knew every
thought that passed through him:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><EM>&ldquo;Esau is still angry. This
is judgment. I am trapped.&rdquo;</EM></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In that panic, Jacob split the
company that was with him into two groups&mdash;flocks, herds, and
people divided.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If Esau attacks one camp,&rdquo;
he thought, &ldquo;the other can escape.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was using cunning again, the old
habit that had once defined him. Yet now his cleverness was mixed
with something new: humility and desperation. And in that
desperation, he did the best thing a man can do&mdash;he turned to
Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There, in his fear, Jacob prayed:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;God of my father Abraham,<BR>God of my father
Isaac,<BR>LORD who said to me, &lsquo;Return to your country and to
your family, and I will do you good,&rsquo;<BR>I am not worthy of the
least of all the kindness and truth you have shown your servant.<BR>With
only my staff I crossed this Jordan,<BR>and now I have become two
camps.<BR>Deliver me, I beg you, from the hand of my brother, from
the hand of Esau.<BR>I fear him, that he will come and strike me
down, and the mothers with the children.<BR>But you said, &lsquo;I
will surely do you good and make your offspring like the sand of the
sea, which cannot be numbered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He confessed his unworthiness. He
clung to My promise. That is what I had been waiting for.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Yet Jacob still leaned on his own
strategies&mdash;and I allowed it, because I was not done with him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">That night he gathered a lavish gift
for his brother, drawn from his wealth:<BR>Two hundred female goats
and twenty male goats,<BR>two hundred ewes and twenty rams,<BR>thirty
milking camels with their young,<BR>forty cows and ten bulls,<BR>twenty
female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as he arranged them into
separate droves, placing servants over each group. He spaced them out
along the road, a moving river of wealth between him and Esau.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob gave instructions to his
servants:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;When Esau my brother meets you and asks, &lsquo;Whose
are you? Where are you going? Whose animals are these in front of

us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He repeated the same command to the
second and third groups, and to all who followed:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;You shall say the same to Esau when you find him.
And be sure to say, &lsquo;Your servant Jacob is behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I heard his reasoning:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><EM>&ldquo;I will soften his anger
with gifts that go ahead of me. I will face him afterward; perhaps he
will accept me.&rdquo;</EM></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the gifts went on before him,
while Jacob stayed that night in the camp, restless and torn between
dread and hope.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before dawn, he rose and moved
again. He took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven
sons and sent them across the ford of the Jabbok. I watched them
cross the dark, flowing water&mdash;one by one, burdened animals,
anxious children, tired women&mdash;into the shadow on the other
side. Then he sent across all that he had.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At last Jacob was alone.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This was where I wanted him:
stripped of defenses, separated from his possessions, with no one
left to scheme with and nowhere left to run. Alone&mdash;with Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the solitude of that night, I
came to him in the form of a man. The darkness wrapped around us like
a cloak. No lightning split the sky, no thunder announced My
presence. I came quietly, as One who could be resisted&mdash;or clung
to.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob did not know, at first, fully
who he was grappling with. He only knew that he was being opposed,
held, tested. So he fought.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I wrestled with him until the
breaking of the day. Every surge of his strength, every stubborn
push, every refusal to let go&mdash;I felt it all. This was the story
of his life, played out in flesh and sweat:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Always striving.<BR>Always
grasping.<BR>Always wrestling&mdash;for blessing, for safety, for a
future.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I could have crushed him in a
breath. Instead, I matched him, measured him, let him spend himself.
I let his muscles burn, his lungs ache. I let time stretch until
night bled into the gray of dawn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When I saw that he would not easily
yield&mdash;that his will clung as fiercely as his hands&mdash;I
touched him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Just a touch.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My finger met the hollow of his
thigh, and his hip joint gave way. Pain shocked through him; his
strength faltered. The man who had out-maneuvered Esau and Laban
alike suddenly found himself broken&mdash;unable to stand without
clinging to the One who had wounded him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The first light began to press
against the horizon. I said to him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Let Me go, for the day is
breaking.&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Jacob, limping and
half-crippled, clung harder.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I will not let You go,&rdquo; he said,<BR>&ldquo;unless
You bless me.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Now he spoke the truth that had
always driven him. All his grasping, all his schemes, all his
cleverness&mdash;underneath it all was hunger for My blessing. At
last, he sought it openly from Me, not by deception of men.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So I asked him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I knew his name. I had spoken it
many times. But he needed to say it&mdash;to confess who he had been.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; he replied.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Heel-grabber. Supplanter. Trickster.
The name itself carried his story.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I answered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Your name shall no longer be
called Jacob,<BR>but Israel,<BR>for you have struggled with God and
with men, and have prevailed.&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In that moment, I was not honoring
his natural strength but his refusal to let go of Me, even when
wounded. He had not won by overpowering God&mdash;no man can. He had
&ldquo;prevailed&rdquo; because he finally clung to Me as his only
hope.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I changed his name to mark the
change I was making in him. The deceiver became a man who wrestled
openly with his God and emerged, limping but blessed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob, gasping and trembling, asked
Me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Tell me Your name, I beg You.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There are times when I reveal My
Name with clarity, and times when I answer only with My actions. That
night, the mystery was part of his transformation. So I replied:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Why do you ask My name?&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I blessed him there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I poured My favor over this bruised,
exhausted man&mdash;promising a future, confirming a covenant,
sealing a new identity. I gave him what his heart had always wanted,
but not in the way he had tried to seize it. Not through cheating,
but through surrender.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After I departed, Jacob named that
place <EM>Peniel</EM>, saying:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I have seen God face to face,<BR>and my life has
been preserved.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As he crossed past Peniel, the sun
rose upon him. He walked into the new day limping because of his hip.
His physical weakness would remain as a reminder: the night he
wrestled with God and was remade.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From then on, the children of Israel
would remember that moment even in their eating habits. They would
not eat the sinew of the hip, on the hollow of the thigh, because
there I had touched Jacob, there I had broken him&mdash;and there I
had given him the name of a nation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He went forward to meet Esau not as
the old Jacob, living by cunning, but as Israel&mdash;marked,
humbled, and blessed.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5>Genesis 33 - 
&ldquo;The Embrace That Undid Twenty Years of Fear&rdquo;</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As dawn broke, Jacob lifted his eyes
and saw Esau coming&mdash;four hundred men with him. For twenty years
Jacob had carried this moment in his mind as a scene of judgment, a
reckoning for the deception that stole a birthright and a blessing.
Now the moment was in front of him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as he arranged his family.
The maidservants and their children went in front, then Leah and her
children, and finally Rachel with Joseph at the rear. He put those he
loved most at the greatest distance from danger, but he did not hide
behind them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob himself went ahead of them
all. As he drew closer to Esau, he bowed to the ground&mdash;once,
twice, again and again&mdash;seven times, until he came near his
brother. The one who had once schemed for the higher place now
lowered himself in full humility.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In Jacob&rsquo;s heart, there was
fear, repentance, and a stubborn clinging to My promise all at once.
He braced for anger.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But I had already been at work in
Esau.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau saw him, and instead of drawing
his sword, he ran toward his brother. He embraced him, threw his arms
around his neck, and kissed him. They both wept.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The years of separation, hatred, and
dread broke in that embrace. Jacob had wrestled with Me in the night;
now I let him see the outcome in the morning.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau lifted his eyes and saw the
women and children standing behind Jacob.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Who are these with you?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob answered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;The children whom God has graciously given your
servant.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the maidservants came near with
their children and bowed. Leah and her children came and bowed. Last
of all came Rachel and Joseph, and they bowed as well. One by one,
the whole family humbled themselves before Esau, and I watched Esau&rsquo;s
anger melt instead of rise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;What do you mean by all these droves I met?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke of the long procession of
animals Jacob had sent ahead as a gift&mdash;wave after wave meant to
soften a hard heart.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob replied:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;They are to find favor in the sight of my lord.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau answered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for
yourself.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Jacob insisted. His heart knew
what he owed, even if Esau no longer demanded it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;No, please&mdash;if I have found favor in your
eyes, accept this gift from my hand.<BR>For seeing your face is like
seeing the face of God, now that you have received me
favorably.<BR>Please take my blessing that has been brought to you,
because God has dealt graciously with me, and I have all I need.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He pressed Esau strongly, and Esau
accepted the gift at last. In that exchange, Jacob gave back, in
part, what he had once stolen by deceit. He honored his brother and
confessed, in action, the wrong of the past.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Esau said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Let us journey on our way; I will go ahead of
you.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob answered carefully, thinking
of the flocks and the children I had placed under his care:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;My lord knows that the children are frail, and
that the flocks and herds with young are with me. If they are driven
too hard, even one day, all the animals will die.<BR>Let my lord go
on ahead of his servant. I will move on slowly, at the pace of the
livestock and the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau offered again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Let me leave with you some of the people who are
with me.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Jacob declined:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Why should this be? Let me simply find favor in
the eyes of my lord.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Esau turned that day and went
back on his way to Seir.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob did not follow him there.
Instead, he traveled toward another place I had appointed for him. He
came to a place he called Succoth. There, he built a house for
himself and made shelters for his livestock. Because of those
shelters, he named the place Succoth, meaning &ldquo;Booths.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From there, Jacob came safely to the
city of Shechem, in the land of Canaan, as he returned from
Paddan-aram. He camped within sight of the city. I had brought him
back into the land I had sworn to give to Abraham and Isaac&mdash;a
promise now resting on him, Israel.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He purchased a piece of the field
where he had pitched his tent, from the sons of Hamor, Shechem&rsquo;s
father, paying them in silver. This was not land taken by trickery or
stolen by force&mdash;it was openly bought, a foothold of promise in
the land I had pledged.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There Jacob built an altar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He called it &ldquo;El-Elohe-Israel&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God,
the God of Israel.&rdquo; The man who had once wrestled Me in the
night now publicly declared Me as his God under his new name. The
deceiver, the fugitive, the fearful brother had crossed a long
road&mdash;from fleeing Esau&rsquo;s wrath to bowing before his
embrace, from grasping blessing by deceit to receiving mercy by
faith.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had kept him, changed him, and
brought him home.</P>
<HR>
<H3 CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 34 -  &ldquo;Honor Defiled, City
Destroyed&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as Dinah, the daughter
Leah had borne to Jacob, grew into a young woman. Curious about the
people among whom her family sojourned, she went out one day to visit
the women of the land around Shechem.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There, Shechem, son of Hamor the
Hivite&mdash;the ruler of that region&mdash;saw her. Desire flared in
him, unrestrained and selfish. He seized her and lay with her,
humiliating her. This act was not love; it was violence and
arrogance. Yet afterward, his heart clung to her. He spoke gently to
her and began to crave her not only with his body, but with his
longing to possess her fully.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Shechem said to his father Hamor:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Get me this girl as my wife.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I saw Hamor&rsquo;s thoughts: he
weighed politics, alliances, trade, and the power that would come
from binding this wealthy Hebrew household to his city.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Word of Dinah&rsquo;s violation
reached Jacob while his sons were still in the fields with the
livestock. Jacob was deeply troubled but kept silent, waiting for his
sons to return. He knew this was not a matter he could face alone; it
involved family honor, future peace, and the danger of living as a
small clan among stronger peoples.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Hamor came out to Jacob to speak
with him. By the time Jacob&rsquo;s sons returned from the field and
heard what had happened, their hearts flared with grief and rage. I
saw the storm in them&mdash;love for their sister twisted with fury
at the insult.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This act, done to their sister, was
a disgrace in Israel&mdash;a thing that should never be tolerated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Hamor spoke to Jacob and his sons:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please
give her to him as a wife.<BR>Let us intermarry: give your daughters
to us and take our daughters for yourselves.<BR>Live among us; the
land will be open to you. Settle here, move about freely, and trade
in it&mdash;make it your home.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Shechem himself spoke, eager
and unashamed:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Let me find favor in your eyes.<BR>Ask of me
whatever bride price and gift you will; I will pay whatever you
say.<BR>Only give me the young woman as my wife.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob&rsquo;s sons answered&mdash;not
with open hearts, but with calculated deceit. They spoke as one, yet
each carried his own anger.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a
man who is uncircumcised; that would be a disgrace to us.<BR>Only on
this condition will we agree: you must become like us and have every
male among you circumcised.<BR>Then we will give you our daughters
and take your daughters for ourselves.<BR>We will live among you and
become one people.<BR>But if you will not listen and be circumcised,
then we will take our daughter and go.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They used the sign of My covenant,
not as a mark of holiness, but as bait in a trap. I saw their plan
and the darkness forming in their hearts. Their grief over Dinah was
real; their desire for justice had begun to twist into merciless
vengeance.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Hamor and Shechem found their words
pleasing. Shechem wasted no time; his desire was urgent. Though he
was the most honored in his father&rsquo;s house, he was willing to
undergo pain and ask the same of all his men for the sake of
possessing Dinah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They went to the gate of their city,
where decisions were made before all the men. Hamor and Shechem
addressed the people:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;These men are peaceful with us. Let them live in
the land and move freely in it.<BR>Look, the land is wide enough for
them. We will take their daughters as wives and give them our
daughters.<BR>Only on this condition will they agree to dwell with us
and become one people: every male among us must be circumcised as
they are.<BR>Won&rsquo;t their livestock, their possessions, and all
their animals become ours? Let us agree to this and let them live
among us.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The men of the city listened&mdash;more
to profit than to justice. Greed and shortsightedness dulled their
caution. Every male in the city agreed and was circumcised.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">On the third day, when the men of
Shechem were in pain and weak from the procedure, Simeon and
Levi&mdash;Dinah&rsquo;s full brothers, sons of Leah&mdash;took up
their swords. Rage guided their steps as they walked into the
unsuspecting city.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as, in their fury, they
slew every male: Hamor, Shechem, and all the men who had trusted
their word. They killed Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of
his house and went away. Their hearts said, <EM>&ldquo;We are purging
evil.&rdquo;</EM> But their hands were drenched in excess.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the rest of Jacob&rsquo;s sons
came upon the dead and plundered the city. Because their sister had
been defiled there, they felt entitled to strip it bare.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They took flocks, herds, and
donkeys&mdash;everything in the city and in the fields. They seized
all their wealth, their little children, and their wives, capturing
them and taking everything that was in their houses.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">What began as righteous outrage
against a grievous sin ended in wholesale slaughter and greed.
Justice blurred into brutality.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob confronted Simeon and Levi:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;You have brought trouble on me, making me odious
to the inhabitants of the land&mdash;the Canaanites and the
Perizzites.<BR>I am few in number; if they gather themselves against
me and attack, they will destroy me and my household.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He saw not only the moral weight of
their actions, but the danger they had now invited upon the entire
family. Surrounded by nations stronger than they, this act could
provoke united retaliation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Simeon and Levi answered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They could not reconcile mercy with
the shame done to Dinah. Their words carried pain and a fierce,
protective love twisted into violence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I took note of it all&mdash;Shechem&rsquo;s
arrogance, Dinah&rsquo;s suffering, the brothers&rsquo; rage, their
bloody deceit, and Jacob&rsquo;s fearful rebuke. Their choices would
echo forward. In days to come, when Jacob blessed his sons, Simeon
and Levi&rsquo;s cruelty would be remembered, and their inheritance
among Israel would be shaped by this day.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I am the God who sees the violated,
who judges the oppressor, and who also weighs the hearts of those who
avenge. Human wrath, unrestrained, does not bring about My
righteousness.</P>

Blessing: Burial, Birth, and Breakthrough&quot; </FONT>
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After the bloodshed at Shechem, I
spoke to Jacob again.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Get up. Go to Bethel. Live
there, and build an altar to Me&mdash;the God who appeared to you
when you fled from Esau your brother.&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He had wandered, compromised, and
lingered too close to the Canaanites. Now I called him back to the
place where his journey with Me in that land had truly begun.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob turned to his household and to
all who were with him. I listened as he said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Put away the foreign gods that are among you.
Purify yourselves and change your clothes.<BR>We are going to Bethel,
and there I will build an altar to the God who answered me in the day
of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They knew what he meant. Over the
years, idols had slipped into the camp&mdash;stolen gods from Laban&rsquo;s
house, household charms, symbols of the peoples around them. Jacob
was finally ready to confront what he had long tolerated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They handed over all the foreign
gods they had, and the earrings from their ears that were tied to
those practices. Jacob took them and buried them under the oak near
Shechem. The idols that could not protect themselves were put into
the ground before the God who had kept Jacob in every place.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then they set out.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As they journeyed, I sent My terror
on the cities around them. The people felt fear rise in their hearts,
though they did not fully understand why. None pursued Jacob&rsquo;s
sons for what they had done in Shechem. I shielded this flawed,
struggling family because My promise rested on them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob came to Luz in the land of
Canaan&mdash;that is, Bethel&mdash;he and all the people with him.
There he built an altar and called the place &ldquo;El-Bethel,&rdquo;
which means &ldquo;God of Bethel,&rdquo; because there I had appeared
to him when he fled from Esau.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Around that time, Deborah, Rebekah&rsquo;s
nurse, died. She had been with the family for many years, a quiet,
faithful presence. They buried her under an oak below Bethel, and
they called that place Allon-bacuth&mdash;&ldquo;the Oak of Weeping.&rdquo;
Their grief was real; I saw every tear.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I appeared to Jacob again,
after he had come from Paddan-aram, and I blessed him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said to him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Your name is Jacob,<BR>but
your name shall no longer be called Jacob.<BR>Israel shall be your
name.&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I affirmed what I had spoken at the
Jabbok. His new name was not a momentary title; it was his identity.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I went on:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I am God Almighty.<BR>Be
fruitful and multiply.<BR>A nation&mdash;indeed, a group of
nations&mdash;shall come from you,<BR>and kings shall come from your
own body.<BR>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac,<BR>I give to
you.<BR>And I will give this land to your descendants after you.&rdquo;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My promise to Abraham and Isaac now
stood firmly on Jacob/Israel. He had limped, failed, feared, and
compromised&mdash;but My word over him remained.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I went up from him at the place
where I had spoken with him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob set up a pillar of stone at
that place, marking where I had spoken with him. He poured out a
drink offering on it and poured oil on it, a sign of devotion and
consecration. He named the place where I had spoken with him
Bethel&mdash;&ldquo;House of God&rdquo;&mdash;just as he had the
night he first saw the ladder to heaven.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Bethel they journeyed on. As
they neared Ephrath, Rachel went into hard labor. Her pains were
severe, and I saw both her strength and her fear.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">During her difficult labor, the
midwife said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Do not be afraid; you have another son.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Rachel&rsquo;s life was slipping
away. As she was dying, she named the child &ldquo;Ben-oni,&rdquo;
which means &ldquo;Son of my sorrow.&rdquo; She spoke out of anguish,
her last breath tied to her pain.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His father, however, called him
&ldquo;Benjamin&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Son of the right hand,&rdquo; son
of strength and favor. Jacob refused to let his last son&rsquo;s
identity be chained only to grief.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rachel died there and was buried on
the way to Ephrath&mdash;that is, Bethlehem. Jacob set up a pillar
over her grave. That marker stood as a testimony: the beloved wife of
Israel, buried beside the road of promise.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Israel moved on again. He
pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder, keeping watch over the
land and the flocks.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">While Israel lived in that region,
Reuben&mdash;his firstborn&mdash;went and slept with Bilhah, his
father&rsquo;s concubine and Rachel&rsquo;s maid. Israel heard of it.
He did not forget. This act would weigh heavily when Jacob later
spoke blessings and judgments over his sons. Reuben&rsquo;s
uncontrolled passion cost him the honor of the firstborn&rsquo;s
position.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were the sons of Jacob:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">By Leah: Reuben (Jacob&rsquo;s
firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.<BR>By Rachel:
Joseph and Benjamin.<BR>By Rachel&rsquo;s maid Bilhah: Dan and
Naphtali.<BR>By Leah&rsquo;s maid Zilpah: Gad and Asher.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These twelve sons would become the
twelve tribes of Israel&mdash;flawed men, each with their own sins
and strengths, yet chosen as the framework of a people.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At last, Jacob came to his father
Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba&mdash;that is, Hebron&mdash;where
Abraham and Isaac had lived as sojourners before him. The long arc
from Beersheba to Haran and back had finally brought Jacob home to
his aged father.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Isaac&rsquo;s life stretched to one
hundred and eighty years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was
gathered to his people, old and full of days. His spirit departed to
join Abraham and those who had gone before in faith.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau and Jacob, the two brothers who
had once been torn apart by deceit and anger, came together again to
bury their father. Over that grave, the story of rival sons reached
another quiet moment of peace.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched them all&mdash;Jacob the
limping patriarch, his twelve sons, the buried idols, the marked
graves, the tears of loss and the weight of promise. Through every
frailty and failure, My covenant remained, and My purposes moved
forward through this chosen family.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 36 -  &ldquo;Esau: From Wounded
Brother to Mountain Kingdom&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These are the generations of Esau.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched Esau, the brother of
Jacob, as his own household grew large and strong. He is the same
Esau who is also called Edom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He took his wives from among the
women of Canaan:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adah, daughter of Elon the
	Hittite, 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and
	granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite, 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Basemath, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To Esau, I gave sons through these
women:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Through Adah came Eliphaz.<BR>Through
Basemath came Reuel.<BR>Through Oholibamah came Jeush, Jaalam, and
Korah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Their births marked the beginnings
of clans that would become a people.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Esau lived in the land of Canaan for
a time, alongside Jacob. Both brothers became very wealthy in
livestock, servants, and goods. I blessed them both, though their
paths were different. Their possessions grew so numerous that the
land where they sojourned together could no longer support them side
by side.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Esau chose to separate from
Jacob. He moved away, toward the hill country of Seir, taking his
wives, sons, daughters, all his household, his livestock, and all the
goods he had gained in Canaan. He settled in the rugged mountains,
and there he became the father of the nation called Edom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I took note of his family lines:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Esau&rsquo;s son Eliphaz (by
Adah) came Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.<BR>Eliphaz also had
a concubine, Timna, and she bore Amalek.<BR>These became the clans
that came from Eliphaz in the land of Edom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Esau&rsquo;s son Reuel (by
Basemath) came Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.<BR>These became
the clans of Reuel in the land of Edom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Oholibamah, Esau&rsquo;s wife
and the daughter of Anah, came Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.<BR>These
also formed clans under Esau.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were the chiefs who descended
from Esau in Edom, each leading his own clan and region under his
name:<BR>From Eliphaz came chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, Korah,
Gatam, and Amalek.<BR>From Reuel came chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah,
and Mizzah.<BR>From Oholibamah came chiefs Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were the chiefs of Esau, who
is Edom. I allowed his household to become not just a family, but a
structured people with rulers, regions, and strength of their own.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The land Esau took was already
inhabited. There dwelt Seir the Horite and his descendants. I also
recorded their lines:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The sons of Seir the Horite in the
land of Edom were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and
Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs in that country.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Lotan came Hori and Hemam. His
sister was Timna.<BR>From Shobal came Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho,
and Onam.<BR>From Zibeon came Aiah and Anah. (This Anah was known for
finding the hot springs in the wilderness while pasturing his father
Zibeon&rsquo;s donkeys.)<BR>From Anah came Dishon and a daughter,
Oholibamah.<BR>From Dishon came Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and
Keran.<BR>From Ezer came Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.<BR>From Dishan
came Uz and Aran.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These Horite families also had
chiefs: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan&mdash;each
chief over his own clan in the land of Seir.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Over time, Edom did not only have
chiefs; it also had kings. I note them before any king ever reigned
over the children of Israel, for I rule over the destinies of all
nations:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bela son of Beor became king in
	Edom; his city was Dinhabah. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Bela died, Jobab son of
	Zerah from Bozrah reigned. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Jobab died, Husham from the
	land of the Temanites reigned. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Husham died, Hadad son of
	Bedad became king; he struck down Midian in the field of Moab. His
	city was Avith. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Hadad died, Samlah from
	Masrekah reigned. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Samlah died, Shaul from
	Rehoboth on the River reigned. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Shaul died, Baal-hanan son
	of Achbor reigned. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>After Baal-hanan died, Hadar (or Hadad) became king; his city
	was Pau. His wife was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, granddaughter
	of Mezahab. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These kings rose and fell under My
sovereign eye, their names fixed in My record though the world would
mostly forget them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Finally, I list the chiefs of Esau
by their families and territories in Edom:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Chiefs Timna, Alvah,
Jetheth,<BR>Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,<BR>Kenaz, Teman,
Mibzar,<BR>Magdiel, and Iram.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were the chiefs of Edom,
according to their settlements and their lands&mdash;the descendants
of Esau, the father of Edom.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob carried the covenant line, but
Esau was not lost to Me. I gave him a land, a people, chiefs, and
kings. I am the God who keeps track of every name, every clan, every
hill-country kingdom that rises on the earth&mdash;even those outside
the line of promise.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 37 -  &ldquo;The Dreamer in the Pit
and the Slave on His Way to a Throne&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob settled in the land of Canaan,
the land where his father Isaac had lived as a stranger. I watched
his household&mdash;twelve sons, herds, tents, and tangled
loyalties&mdash;take root there.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Among his sons, Joseph stood out. At
seventeen, he was still a youth, helping his brothers tend the
flocks&mdash;especially the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father&rsquo;s
concubines. Joseph saw their corrupt behavior in the fields, and he
brought their bad actions back to his father. Truth-telling and
immaturity mixed in him; his words were not lies, but they stirred
resentment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more
than any of his other sons, because Joseph was the son of his old age
and the child of the wife he had loved most. To mark this favor,
Jacob made him a special robe&mdash;long, richly decorated, a garment
of distinction. Every time Joseph walked among his brothers in that
robe, it silently announced: <EM>I am favored. You are not.</EM></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His brothers saw their father&rsquo;s
partiality, and their hearts hardened. They hated Joseph and could
not bring themselves to speak to him with any kindness.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I gave Joseph dreams.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In one dream, he was in the field
binding sheaves of grain with his brothers. Suddenly his sheaf rose
up and stood upright, while the sheaves of his brothers gathered
around and bowed down to it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph, not yet wise in timing or
tone, told the dream to his brothers. I heard their reaction:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Are you really going to reign over us?<BR>Will you
actually rule us?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His dream deepened their hatred.
Already they resented his reports. Now they resented his destiny.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I gave him another dream. This time,
he saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He told this dream as well&mdash;to
his brothers and to his father. Jacob rebuked him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;What is this dream you have had?<BR>Am I, your
mother, and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the
ground before you?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His brothers envied him. Jacob was
puzzled, even offended&mdash;but he kept the matter in mind. He did
not yet see the path, but he sensed that more was at work than a
boy&rsquo;s pride.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Time passed, and Joseph&rsquo;s
brothers went out to pasture their father&rsquo;s flocks near
Shechem. Israel said to Joseph:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Your brothers are pasturing the flocks at Shechem.
Come, I will send you to them.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph answered:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Go now, see how your brothers and the flocks are
doing, and bring word back to me.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph left the valley of Hebron and
started toward Shechem. I watched him travel, unaware that he was
walking straight into the turning point of his life.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When he reached Shechem, his
brothers were nowhere to be found. A man found him wandering in the
fields and asked:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph replied:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please,
where they are pasturing the flock.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve moved from here. I heard them say,
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Dothan.&rsquo;&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Joseph went after his brothers
and found them at Dothan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They saw him coming from far off.
Even before he reached them, they knew that walk, that robe. I heard
the words they spoke as hatred boiled to the surface:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Look, here comes that dreamer.<BR>Now then, come,
let&rsquo;s kill him and throw him into one of the pits.<BR>We&rsquo;ll
say a wild animal has devoured him.<BR>Then we&rsquo;ll see what
becomes of his dreams.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They were not merely angry about a
brother; they were fighting against a future I Myself had set in
motion. Yet even in their malice I was at work.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Reuben, Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn,
heard their plan. He stepped in, seeking to rescue Joseph without
directly opposing his brothers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not take his life.<BR>Don&rsquo;t shed
blood.<BR>Throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but don&rsquo;t
lay a hand on him.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He intended to come back later, lift
Joseph out, and return him safely to their father. Fear of bloodguilt
and a flicker of conscience stirred in him, though he lacked the
courage to confront their rage outright.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Joseph reached his brothers,
their greeting was swift and violent. They stripped him of his
robe&mdash;the special, long garment that had marked him as favored.
Stripped of that, he was just another younger brother in their hands.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They grabbed him and threw him into
an empty cistern. There was no water in it&mdash;only darkness, dust,
and helplessness. From the bottom of that pit, Joseph cried out; I
heard every plea. His brothers turned away.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then they sat down to eat.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">While they were eating, they lifted
their eyes and saw a caravan approaching: Ishmaelite traders coming
from Gilead, their camels loaded with spices, balm, and myrrh,
heading down to Egypt. I had ordered their timing long before Joseph
had his first dream.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah spoke up:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;What profit is there if we kill our brother and
cover up his blood?<BR>Come, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites,
and not lay our hands on him.<BR>He is our brother, our own flesh,
after all.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His words did not spring from
compassion alone; he sought gain and an easier conscience. But
through even that mixed motive, I opened a path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The other brothers agreed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So when Midianite traders passed by,
they hauled Joseph up out of the pit. The boy who had seen sheaves
and stars bow to him found himself bound, powerless, and sold like an
animal. They exchanged their brother for twenty pieces of silver. The
traders led Joseph away toward Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Reuben had not been present when the
sale took place. Later he returned to the pit, planning to rescue
Joseph. When he saw the pit was empty, he tore his clothes in
anguish. He came back to his brothers and cried:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;The boy is gone!<BR>And I&mdash;where can I go?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Rather than confess the truth to
their father, the brothers chose deception&mdash;walking the same
path their father had once walked with Esau.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They took Joseph&rsquo;s robe,
slaughtered a male goat, and dipped the robe in the blood. Then they
sent the long robe to their father and said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;We found this. Examine it carefully. Is it your
son&rsquo;s robe or not?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob recognized it. Grief ripped
through him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;It is my son&rsquo;s robe.<BR>A fierce animal has
devoured him.<BR>Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They had not spoken the lie
outright, but they guided his mind to it. The deceiver of old now
tasted the full bitterness of being deceived.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob tore his clothes, put
sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days. All
his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be
comforted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I will go down to my son, mourning, to the grave.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So his father wept for him. I saw
every tear; I heard every broken word. He believed Joseph was gone
forever; I knew Joseph was on the road to the very place where I
would raise him up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Meanwhile, the Midianite traders
took Joseph down to Egypt. There, they sold him to Potiphar, an
officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Jacob&rsquo;s standpoint, the
story had ended in a torn robe and a grave in his mind. From My
standpoint, the story had just entered its next act.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had given Joseph dreams of rising
above his brothers. Now I placed him in a foreign land, a slave in
the house of a powerful Egyptian.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His robe was gone, his family far
away, his status destroyed. But My presence went with him. Through
betrayal, chains, and distance, I was positioning him&mdash;not only
for his own sake, but to preserve many lives in the years to come.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His brothers thought they had
silenced the dreamer. They had only helped move My plan forward.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE=5>Genesis 38 -  &ldquo;Scandal, Seed, and the
Line of Kings&rdquo;</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In those days, Judah drew away from
his brothers. I watched him leave their camp and turn southward,
settling near a man of Adullam whose name was Hirah. Distance from
his family did not distance him from My sight.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There Judah saw the daughter of a
Canaanite man named Shuah. He took her as his wife and went in to
her. She conceived and bore a son; Judah called him Er. She conceived
again and bore a second son, Onan. Later she bore a third son,
Shelah. Judah was in Kezib when Shelah was born.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Er grew, Judah chose a wife for
him, a woman named Tamar. She stepped into this family not knowing
what it would cost her.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Er, Judah&rsquo;s firstborn, was
evil in My eyes. I saw his heart, his deeds, what others did not see.
I put him to death. The text is brief; My judgment was not.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah then said to Onan:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Go in to your brother&rsquo;s wife. Perform the
duty of a brother-in-law for her and raise up offspring for your
brother.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This was the expectation: that the
line of the dead brother would continue through the surviving
brother, and the inheritance would not be cut off.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Onan knew that the child would not
be counted as his. So whenever he went in to his brother&rsquo;s
wife, he spilled his seed on the ground, making sure Tamar would not
conceive. He wanted pleasure without responsibility, intimacy without
legacy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">What he did was evil in My eyes. I
put him to death also.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Now Judah had lost two sons, both
husbands of Tamar. His grief mixed with fear and superstition. He did
not examine his sons&rsquo; hearts; instead, in his mind, danger
seemed to cling to Tamar.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah said to Tamar, his
daughter-in-law:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Stay a widow in your father&rsquo;s house until my
son Shelah grows up.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But inside, he was thinking:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he will die too, like his
brothers.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Tamar returned to her father&rsquo;s
house, wearing widow&rsquo;s garments, waiting for a promise Judah
did not intend to keep.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Time passed. Judah&rsquo;s wife, the
daughter of Shuah, died. After his time of mourning, Judah went up to
Timnah to shear his sheep, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Tamar was told:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear
his sheep.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She saw that Shelah had grown up,
but she had not been given to him as a wife. She understood: Judah
had left her abandoned, a widow in name, with no future in his house.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So she made a plan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Tamar removed her widow&rsquo;s
garments and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up so she
could not be recognized. Then she sat at the entrance to Enaim, which
is on the way to Timnah. She did not choose the role people would
assume for her, but she used the expectations of that place to
confront injustice.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Judah saw her, he thought she
was a prostitute, because her face was covered. He turned aside to
her by the roadside and said, &ldquo;Come now, let me come in to
you,&rdquo; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She asked, &ldquo;What will you give
me, that you may come in to me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;I will send you a
young goat from the flock.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She replied, &ldquo;Only if you give
me a pledge until you send it.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah said, &ldquo;What pledge shall
I give you?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">And she answered, &ldquo;Your signet
seal, and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were his personal
marks&mdash;symbols of identity and authority. He agreed and gave
them to her. Then he went in to her, and I caused her to conceive by
him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Afterward Tamar arose, left that
place, removed her veil, and put back on her widow&rsquo;s clothing.
She returned to the hidden life everyone expected of her, now
carrying a secret that would expose the truth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah sent the young goat by his
friend Hirah to retrieve his pledge from the woman. But Hirah could
not find her. He asked the men of that place, &ldquo;Where is the
cult prostitute who was at Enaim by the road?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered, &ldquo;There has been
no prostitute here.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Hirah returned to Judah and said,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find her. The men of the place said there has
been no prostitute there.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah said, &ldquo;Let her keep the
things, or we will become a laughingstock. I sent this young goat,
but you couldn&rsquo;t find her.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He chose to protect his reputation
rather than pursue the matter further. He did not yet know that the
pledge he was willing to leave in her hands would soon be displayed
before all.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">About three months later, Judah was
told:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the
prostitute. And moreover, she is pregnant by her prostitution.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah responded with harshness and
hypocrisy, &ldquo;Bring her out, and let her be burned.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The man who had sought a prostitute
now demanded death for a woman who, he believed, had done the same.
His standard for her was sharper than the one he used for himself.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As they brought her out, she sent
word to her father-in-law:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said, &ldquo;Please recognize
whose these are: the signet, the cord, and the staff.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah looked and recognized them. In
that moment, his own secrets stood in front of him. The shame he had
feared now came as righteous exposure, and he could not deny it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;She is more
righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He acknowledged his failure and her
desperate, if unconventional, pursuit of justice within the family
line. From that point on, he did not sleep with her again.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the time came for Tamar to give
birth, there were twins in her womb.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">During the birth, one child put out
a hand. The midwife tied a scarlet thread around his wrist and said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;This one came out first.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But he drew back his hand, and his
brother came out ahead of him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She said, &ldquo;What a breach you
have made for yourself!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So he was named Perez, meaning
&ldquo;breaking out&rdquo; or &ldquo;breach.&rdquo; Afterward his
brother came out with the scarlet thread still on his hand, and he
was named Zerah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was at work in all of this.
Through scandal, sin, deceit, and unexpected courage, I brought forth
Perez&mdash;through whom, generations later, David would be born, and
after David, the Messiah.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah, who had plotted to sell
Joseph and who failed Tamar, would one day become the ancestor of
kings and of the King. Tamar, misused and nearly destroyed, would be
honored in the lineage of My Son.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I see the abused, the cast aside,
the woman blamed while men hide. I also see repentance, even late and
humbled. My purposes move forward through broken people and broken
stories, and My redemption often begins where human judgment is most
harsh.</P>

Bend and the Prisoner I Raised Up&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph was taken down to Egypt, far
from his father&rsquo;s tents and the land of Canaan. The Midianite
traders who bought him from his brothers sold him again in the slave
markets of Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was purchased by an Egyptian
named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard&mdash;a
man of rank and authority in that land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was with Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Though he wore chains and served as
a slave, I caused him to prosper. In Potiphar&rsquo;s house,
everything Joseph did flourished. Potiphar watched him closely and
saw that I, the LORD, made all Joseph&rsquo;s work succeed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Potiphar favored him. Joseph
found grace in his eyes and was made his personal attendant. Potiphar
put Joseph in charge of his household and placed everything he owned
under Joseph&rsquo;s authority.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From the moment Joseph was made
overseer, I blessed Potiphar&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake.
My favor rested not only on what was in the house, but also on what
was in the fields. Potiphar trusted Joseph so fully that he left
everything in his hands and concerned himself with nothing but the
food he ate.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph grew into a strong and
handsome young man&mdash;attractive in form and face. I saw the gaze
of Potiphar&rsquo;s wife begin to linger on him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After some time, she spoke plainly:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph refused. Day after day she
pressed him, but he would not give in. I heard his heart and his
words.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to her:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Look, my master trusts me with everything in this
house. He doesn&rsquo;t concern himself with anything here; he&rsquo;s
put all that he has under my care. In this house he is not greater
than I, and he has held nothing back from me except you, because you
are his wife.<BR>How then could I do this great evil and sin against
God?&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He did not only think of his
master&rsquo;s trust; he thought of Me. He measured the offer not by
pleasure, but by righteousness. So when she spoke to him day after
day, he did not listen to her, did not lie with her, and did not even
stay near her.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then came the day when the test
sharpened.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph went into the house to do his
work, and none of the household servants were inside. Potiphar&rsquo;s
wife seized the opportunity. She grabbed him by his garment and said
again:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In that instant, Joseph chose flight
over compromise. He left his garment in her hand and ran outside. He
lost his cloak, but kept his integrity.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When she saw that he had left his
garment with her and fled, her desire twisted into accusation. She
called the men of the household and said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;See, he has brought us a Hebrew to make a mockery
of us. He came in to me to lie with me, but I cried out with a loud
voice. And when he heard me raise my voice and scream, he left his
garment beside me and ran outside.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">She kept Joseph&rsquo;s garment
beside her until his master came home. Then she repeated her version
to him:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;That Hebrew servant you brought to us came in to
make a fool of me. But when I raised my voice and cried out, he left
his garment beside me and fled outside.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Potiphar heard the words his wife
spoke&mdash;words charged with fear, shame, and accusation&mdash;and
his anger burned. Whether his anger was more at Joseph, at the
situation, or at his own loss of face, I saw it all.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph&rsquo;s master took him and
had him thrown into prison&mdash;the place where the king&rsquo;s
prisoners were confined. The man I was training for leadership found
himself locked away, his faithfulness repaid with chains.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But I was with Joseph in the prison,
just as I had been in Potiphar&rsquo;s house.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I showed him steadfast love and
granted him favor in the eyes of the warden. The keeper of the prison
saw that Joseph could be trusted, and he put Joseph in charge of all
the prisoners. Whatever was done there, Joseph was the one who
oversaw it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The warden did not worry about
anything under Joseph&rsquo;s care, because I was with him. Whatever
Joseph did, I made it succeed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph&rsquo;s outward situation had
shifted: from favored son to slave, from trusted steward to prisoner.
Yet My presence had not changed. While others saw rise and fall,
promotion and disgrace, I was shaping a man whose character would
hold the weight of the future I planned for him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He had been faithful with another
man&rsquo;s house. Soon, in My time, he would be faithful over a
kingdom.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 40 -  &ldquo;Dreams Behind Bars and a
Man the King Forgot&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph remained in the prison where
Pharaoh&rsquo;s prisoners were confined. The walls were thick, the
air stale, but I was there with him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In time, two of Pharaoh&rsquo;s
officials offended their king: the chief cupbearer, who handled
Pharaoh&rsquo;s wine, and the chief baker, who prepared his bread.
Pharaoh was furious with them and threw them into custody in the same
prison where Joseph was held.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The captain of the guard assigned
Joseph to attend them. Joseph, who had once overseen a great
household, now served two disgraced officials in a jail. Yet even
here, I was shaping his path.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After they had been in custody for
some time, both men had dreams on the same night&mdash;each with its
own meaning. I gave them those dreams.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the morning, Joseph came to them
and saw that they were troubled. He asked, &ldquo;Why do you look so
down today?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered, &ldquo;We have had
dreams, and there is no one here to interpret them.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph replied, &ldquo;Interpretations
belong to God. Tell them to me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He knew that whatever understanding
came would come from Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The chief cupbearer spoke first. He
said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;In my dream, I saw a vine
before me. On the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, its
blossoms opened and clusters ripened into grapes. Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup
was in my hand. I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh&rsquo;s
cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I gave Joseph the meaning. He said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;This is its
interpretation:<BR>The three branches are three days.<BR>Within three
days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your
position. You will place Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup in his hand again, just
as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But when it goes well with you,
remember me. Show me kindness. Mention me to Pharaoh and get me out
of this prison. I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews,
and here I have done nothing that should put me in this dungeon.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph spoke honestly&mdash;about
the injustice of his slavery and his imprisonment&mdash;but he did
not complain against Me. He reached for human help, not yet knowing
how long My timetable would stretch.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the chief baker saw that the
interpretation for the cupbearer was favorable, he also said to
Joseph:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;In my dream, I had three
baskets of white bread on my head. In the top basket were all kinds
of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the
basket on my head.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Again, I gave Joseph the meaning. He
did not soften the truth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;This is its
interpretation:<BR>The three baskets are three days.<BR>Within three
days, Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree, and the
birds will eat your flesh.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph spoke what I showed him, even
though it was grim. Faithfulness in My service is not only delivering
good news.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Three days later, it was Pharaoh&rsquo;s
birthday. He made a feast for all his servants and, before them all,
brought the chief cupbearer and the chief baker out of prison.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There, exactly as I had revealed
through Joseph, Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position.
The cupbearer once again placed the cup in Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">And Pharaoh executed the chief
baker, hanging him, and birds fed on his body&mdash;just as Joseph
had said.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I confirmed Joseph&rsquo;s gift,
even in a dungeon, by making every detail of those interpretations
come to pass.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Yet the chief cupbearer, once free
and restored, did not remember Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He forgot him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Days turned into weeks, weeks into
years. Joseph remained in the prison, faithful, overlooked by men but
not by Me. I was not late. I was waiting for the exact moment when
Pharaoh himself would dream and all of Egypt would seek an
interpreter.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Until then, the man the king forgot
remained the man I was preparing.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 41 -  &ldquo;From Pharaoh&rsquo;s
Nightmare to Joseph&rsquo;s Crown&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Two full years passed after the
cupbearer left the prison. Joseph was still there&mdash;managing the
prisoners, faithful in small things, waiting with no visible way out.
I had not forgotten him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I disturbed the sleep of a
king.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing
by the Nile. From the river he saw seven cows come up&mdash;well-fed,
sleek, strong. They grazed among the reeds.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After them, seven other cows came up
from the Nile&mdash;gaunt, ugly, their ribs showing, sickly in
appearance. They stood beside the healthy cows on the riverbank.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the seven thin, ugly cows
devoured the seven well-fed cows. Yet even after they had eaten them,
they still looked just as thin and miserable as before.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh woke&mdash;troubled,
unsettled, shaken.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He slept again and dreamed a second
time.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This time, he saw seven heads of
grain growing on a single stalk&mdash;plump, full, and good. After
them, seven thin heads of grain sprang up, scorched by the hot east
wind. The thin heads swallowed up the seven full heads.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh woke. It was morning. His
spirit was deeply disturbed. I had spoken to him in symbols that he
could not escape and could not understand.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He summoned all the magicians and
wise men of Egypt and told them his dreams. They listened, thought,
debated&mdash;but none could give him an interpretation that
satisfied his spirit. Their wisdom failed them where Mine was
required.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then I stirred the memory of one
man.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The chief cupbearer spoke to
Pharaoh:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Today I remember my offenses.
When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, he put me and the chief
baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard. One night
we both had dreams, each with its own meaning. There was with us a
young Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our
dreams, and he interpreted them for us. And it happened just as he
said: I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh immediately sent for Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They hurried him out of the prison.
He was shaved and given fresh clothes&mdash;years of confinement
stripped away in a moment&mdash;and brought before Pharaoh.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh said to Joseph:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I have had a dream, and no
one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you
hear a dream, you can interpret it.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph answered in front of the
throne of Egypt:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;It is not in me. God will
give Pharaoh an answer of peace.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph did not claim power for
himself; he pointed to Me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh then described both
dreams&mdash;of the cows and the grain&mdash;exactly as they had come
to him in the night.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I gave Joseph understanding.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to Pharaoh:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s dreams are
one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of
grain are seven years; it is one message. The seven thin, ugly cows
that came up after them, and the seven thin heads scorched by the
east wind, are seven years of famine.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">There will come seven years of great
abundance throughout all the land of Egypt. After them will come
seven years of famine, and all the abundance will be forgotten. The
famine will ravage the land so severely that the former plenty will
not be remembered.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The fact that the dream came to
Pharaoh twice means that the matter has been firmly decided by God,
and God will bring it about soon.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So now, let Pharaoh choose a
discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. Let
Pharaoh appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the
produce during the seven plentiful years. Let them gather all this
food under Pharaoh&rsquo;s authority, store up grain in the cities,
and hold it in reserve. This food will be a supply for the land
during the seven years of famine, so that the land may not be ruined
by the famine.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh and all his servants
listened. What Joseph said pleased them. I moved their hearts to
recognize wisdom when they heard it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh said to his servants:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Can we find anyone like this
man, in whom is the spirit of God?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Since God has made all this
known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you. You
shall be over my house, and all my people will obey your word. Only
with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">See, I am placing you over all the
land of Egypt.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh took his signet ring from
his own hand and put it on Joseph&rsquo;s hand. He clothed Joseph in
fine linen garments and placed a gold chain around his neck. The
slave from Canaan now wore the symbols of Egyptian power.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He had Joseph ride in the second
chariot he owned, and they called out before him:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Bow the knee!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched as Joseph, once thrown
into a pit by his brothers, was honored by a foreign nation. Pharaoh
set him over all the land of Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh said to Joseph:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I am Pharaoh, but without
your word no one will lift hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He gave Joseph an Egyptian name:
Zaphenath-paneah. He gave him a wife: Asenath, daughter of Potiphera,
priest of On. Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before
Pharaoh king of Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph went out through all the land
of Egypt, inspecting, organizing, preparing. In the seven years of
abundance, the land produced in great measure. Joseph gathered up all
the surplus food of those seven years and stored it in the cities. In
each city, he stored the grain from the fields surrounding it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The grain was so much&mdash;like the
sand of the sea&mdash;that Joseph stopped keeping count. It could not
be measured.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Before the famine years came, I gave
Joseph two sons through Asenath.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He named the firstborn Manasseh,
saying:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;God has made me forget all my
hardship and all my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He named the second son Ephraim,
saying:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;God has made me fruitful in
the land of my affliction.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Even as he succeeded in Egypt,
Joseph&rsquo;s mind was still on Me&mdash;on pain transformed and
affliction turned into fruitfulness.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the seven years of abundance in
the land of Egypt came to an end.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The seven years of famine began,
just as I had said through Joseph. There was famine in all the
surrounding lands, but in all Egypt there was bread.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Egypt began to feel the hunger
and the people cried to Pharaoh for food, Pharaoh said to all Egypt:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Go to Joseph. Do whatever he
tells you.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had taken Joseph from prisoner to
the man everyone had to go through to live.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The famine spread over the entire
known region. Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the
Egyptians, and the famine was severe in the land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">People from all countries came to
Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was strong in all
the earth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had positioned Joseph&mdash;betrayed,
sold, falsely accused, imprisoned&mdash;precisely where he needed to
be to preserve life. Soon his own brothers would stand before him,
bowing down just as in his dreams, never imagining that the ruler of
Egypt&rsquo;s grain was the boy they had wanted to erase.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">What they meant for evil, I was
already turning toward salvation for many.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 42 -  &ldquo;The Famine, the
Brothers&rsquo; Guilt, and the Prince They Didn&rsquo;t Recognize&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The famine I had warned about spread
across the lands. In Canaan, Jacob and his sons began to feel its
bite. Their herds dwindled; their supplies shrank.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob heard that there was grain in
Egypt. I watched him look at his sons&mdash;strong men standing idle
while hunger crept closer.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;Why are you just
looking at each other? I&rsquo;ve heard there is grain in Egypt. Go
down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So ten of Joseph&rsquo;s brothers
went down to buy grain in Egypt. But Jacob did not send Benjamin,
Joseph&rsquo;s full brother; Joseph and Benjamin were the sons of
Rachel, the wife he had loved most.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid something might happen to him.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Benjamin stayed; the others went.
The same group of brothers who had once sold Joseph now walked toward
the place where I had raised him up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had put Joseph in charge of the
land. He was the governor who sold grain to everyone who came. People
from many nations streamed into Egypt; among them, Joseph&rsquo;s
brothers arrived.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They came before him and bowed with
their faces to the ground.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched Joseph see them and
recognize them at once. They did not recognize him&mdash;he was
older, clothed in Egyptian power, speaking a foreign tongue through
an interpreter. But Joseph knew.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In that moment, he remembered the
dreams I had given him when he was a boy: sheaves bowing, stars
bending low. Those dreams stood in front of him, fulfilled.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke harshly to them, by My
design, to test their hearts.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;
he demanded.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered, &ldquo;From the land
of Canaan, to buy food.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;You are spies! You
have come to see where our land is unprotected.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They replied, &ldquo;No, my lord,
your servants have come only to buy food. We are all sons of one man.
Your servants are honest men; we are not spies.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph pushed them, &ldquo;No. You
have come to see where the land is open to attack.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered again, &ldquo;Your
servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in Canaan. The
youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They spoke of Joseph as if he were
dead, not knowing they were speaking to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph said, &ldquo;It is just as I
told you: you are spies. This is how you will be tested: As surely as
Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest
brother comes here. Send one of you to get your brother; the rest of
you will be kept in prison. Then your words will be tested to see if
you are telling the truth. If not, as surely as Pharaoh lives, you
are spies.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he put them all together in
custody for three days. I let them sit there&mdash;time for old sins
to rise in their minds.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">On the third day Joseph said to
them:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Do this and you will live,
for I fear God. If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay
here in prison, while the rest of you go and carry grain for the
hunger of your households. Then bring your youngest brother to me, so
that your words may be verified and you will not die.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They agreed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Their consciences woke up. I heard
what they said to one another:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Surely we are guilty
concerning our brother. We saw the distress of his soul when he
begged us, and we would not listen; that is why this trouble has come
on us.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Reuben reminded them:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you not
to sin against the boy? But you wouldn&rsquo;t listen. Now there is a
reckoning for his blood.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They did not know Joseph understood,
because he had been using an interpreter. Their confession cut him
deeply. He turned away from them and wept.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he came back, chose Simeon, and
had him bound before their eyes. Simeon stayed in Egypt in chains
while the others watched, helpless. I was using this to press their
guilt and awaken their hearts.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph ordered that their bags be
filled with grain, that each man&rsquo;s silver be returned secretly
to his sack, and that they be given provision for the journey. They
loaded their donkeys and left.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">On the way home, at a place where
they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to give
fodder to his donkey. He saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to his brothers:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;My silver has been returned!
Here it is, in my sack!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Their hearts failed them. They
trembled and said to one another:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What is this that God has
done to us?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They felt My hand on their past. The
kindness that should have comforted them instead terrified them,
because their consciences were unclean.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They came to Jacob their father in
Canaan and told him all that had happened:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The man who is lord over the
land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on
the land. But we said to him, &lsquo;We are honest men; we are not
spies. We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more,
and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then the man who is lord over the
land said, &lsquo;This is how I will know if you are honest men:
Leave one of your brothers with me, take grain for the hunger of your
households and go. But bring your youngest brother to me so I will
know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your
brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As they emptied their sacks, each
man discovered his pouch of silver in his sack. When they and their
father saw the money, they were afraid.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said, &ldquo;You have bereaved
me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and now you
would take Benjamin. All this has come against me!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Reuben spoke to his father: &ldquo;You
may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you.
Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Jacob said, &ldquo;My son shall
not go down with you. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of
his mother&rsquo;s sons. If harm comes to him on the journey you are
taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Benjamin stayed. Simeon remained
bound in Egypt. The brothers carried heavy grain and heavier guilt.
Jacob clung to his last son of Rachel, not knowing that Joseph still
lived and that I was using famine, fear, and an unknown governor in
Egypt to draw this fractured family to confession, healing, and
reunion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My plan was not finished. I had not
only Joseph&rsquo;s future in view, but theirs&mdash;and the future
of a nation yet unborn.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 43 -  &ldquo;The Brother as Pledge
and the Feast Before the Test&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The famine grew worse in the land of
Canaan. The grain the brothers had brought from Egypt was eaten up.
Hunger pressed Jacob&rsquo;s household again.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said to his sons, &ldquo;Go
back and buy us a little more food.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Judah answered plainly:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The man solemnly warned us,
&lsquo;You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.&rsquo;
If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you
food. But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the
man said, &lsquo;You will not see my face unless your brother is with
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel (Jacob) said, &ldquo;Why did
you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another
brother?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They replied, &ldquo;The man
questioned us carefully about ourselves and our family. He asked, &lsquo;Is
your father still alive? Do you have another brother?&rsquo; We
answered his questions. How could we know he would say, &lsquo;Bring
your brother down&rsquo;?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Judah said to his father:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Send the boy with me, and we
will arise and go, so that we may live and not die&mdash;both we and
you and our little ones. I will be surety for him; from my hand you
shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him
before you, then I will bear the blame before you all my life. If we
had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice by now.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I watched Judah step into
responsibility he had once avoided. The same son who suggested
selling Joseph now offered himself as guarantee for Benjamin.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then their father Israel said, 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If it must be so, then do
this: Take some of the best products of the land in your bags and
carry a present down to the man&mdash;a little balm and a little
honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds. Take
double the money with you, and carry back in your hands the money
that was returned in the mouths of your sacks; it may have been a
mistake. Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">And may God Almighty grant you mercy
before the man so that he will release your other brother and
Benjamin. And as for me&mdash;if I am bereaved of my children, I am
bereaved.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So the men took the gift, double the
money, and Benjamin. They went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Joseph saw Benjamin with them,
something deep in him stirred. He said to the steward of his house,
&ldquo;Bring the men into the house, slaughter an animal, and make
ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The steward did as Joseph said and
brought the men to Joseph&rsquo;s house.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They were afraid when they were
taken into the house. In their minds, their earlier silver burned
like guilt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said to one another:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;It is because of the money
returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in. He
is seeking a pretext, that he may fall upon us, seize us, and make us
slaves and take our donkeys.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At the door of the house they
approached Joseph&rsquo;s steward and spoke to him:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Oh, my lord, we indeed came
down the first time to buy food. When we came to the lodging place,
we opened our sacks, and each man&rsquo;s money was in the mouth of
his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it back with
us. We have also brought additional money to buy food. We do not know
who put our money in our sacks.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The steward replied:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Peace to you; do not be
afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in
your sacks; your money came to me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had arranged the returned silver
as both a kindness and a test. He then brought Simeon out to them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The steward brought the men into
Joseph&rsquo;s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and
provided fodder for their donkeys. They prepared their gift, waiting
for Joseph, because they had heard they were to eat there at noon.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Joseph came home, they brought
into the house the gift they had prepared and bowed to the ground
before him. Again their bodies fulfilled the dreams I had given
Joseph long ago.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He asked them about their welfare
and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Is your father well, the old
man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered, &ldquo;Your servant
our father is well; he is still alive.&rdquo; Then they bowed their
heads and prostrated themselves.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph lifted his eyes and saw
Benjamin, his mother&rsquo;s son. He said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Is this your youngest
brother, of whom you spoke to me?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he said to Benjamin:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;May God be gracious to you,
my son.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His heart burned with love for his
brother. Overcome, he hurried out and sought a private room to weep.
There he wept deeply.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After he washed his face, he came
out, controlled himself, and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Serve the meal.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They served him by himself, and them
by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by
themselves&mdash;because Egyptians would not eat bread with Hebrews,
for that was detestable to them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The brothers were seated before him,
the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according
to his youth. They looked at one another in astonishment. They did
not know that the one who ordered their places also knew their birth
order from childhood.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph had portions taken to them
from his own table, but Benjamin&rsquo;s portion was five times as
much as any of theirs. I let this small favor be another test of
their hearts&mdash;would they repeat their jealousy toward the
favored son?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They drank and were merry with him.
Fear eased for the moment. They tasted honor where they had expected
accusation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Yet Joseph&rsquo;s work with them
was not finished. I was still exposing, reshaping, and healing.
Through another test, another crisis, I would show what had changed
in these brothers&mdash;and prepare them for the moment when their
guilt and My grace would meet face to face.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 44 -  &ldquo;The Cup, the Confession,
and the Brother Who Stepped Forward&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph&rsquo;s brothers had eaten
and drunk with him. Their fear had eased. They thought the hardest
part of Egypt was behind them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">It was not.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was still at work in Joseph, and
through him, testing the hearts of his brothers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph gave orders to the steward of
his house:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Fill the men&rsquo;s sacks
with as much food as they can carry, and put each man&rsquo;s silver
in the mouth of his sack. Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of
the youngest one&rsquo;s sack, along with the silver for his grain.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The steward did exactly as Joseph
commanded.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">At first light, the men were sent
off with their donkeys. They left the city, believing themselves
safe. They carried grain&mdash;but also a hidden test.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">After they had gone only a short
distance, Joseph said to his steward:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Get up, follow after the men.
When you overtake them, say to them:<BR>&lsquo;Why have you repaid
good with evil? Is this not the cup my lord drinks from and by which
he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The steward went after them, caught
up to them, and spoke those words.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They replied:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Why does my lord say such
things? Far be it from your servants to do this. Look&mdash;the money
which we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from
the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your
lord&rsquo;s house?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">If any of your servants is found
with it, he shall die, and the rest of us will become my lord&rsquo;s
slaves.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Their confidence was sincere&mdash;but
they did not know what Joseph had arranged.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The steward answered:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Let it be as you have
said&mdash;only the one who is found with it shall be my slave, and
the rest of you shall be innocent.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then, one by one, he searched them,
beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. They watched
as each sack was opened.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The cup was found in Benjamin&rsquo;s
sack.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They tore their clothes in anguish.
Each man loaded his donkey again and returned to the city. They could
have abandoned Benjamin and gone home free, as the steward had
permitted. Instead, they all turned back together. Already, their
hearts were different from the day they had sold Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph was still in his house when
Judah and his brothers came in. They fell to the ground before him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What is this deed that you
have done? Don&rsquo;t you know that a man like me can indeed
practice divination?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He was not asking for information;
he was pressing their conscience.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah replied:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;What can we say to my lord?
What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has found out the
guilt of your servants. We are my lord&rsquo;s slaves, both we and
the one in whose sack the cup has been found.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He did not protest the innocence of
the others. He read their suffering in light of an older sin. He saw
My hand exposing them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Joseph said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Far be it from me to do that.
The man in whose hand the cup was found&mdash;he shall be my slave.
But as for you&mdash;go up in peace to your father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Here was the sharpest test: would
they abandon another favored son to save themselves, as they had done
with Joseph? Or would they finally stand for their father and their
brother?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Judah stepped forward.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Oh, my lord, please let your
servant speak a word in my lord&rsquo;s ears, and do not be angry
with your servant&mdash;for you are like Pharaoh himself.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">My lord asked his servants, &lsquo;Do
you have a father or a brother?&rsquo; And we said to my lord, &lsquo;We
have a father, an old man, and a younger brother, the child of his
old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother&rsquo;s
children, and his father loves him.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then you said to your servants,
&lsquo;Bring him down to me, that I may see him with my own eyes.&rsquo;
We said to my lord, &lsquo;The boy cannot leave his father, for if he
should leave, his father would die.&rsquo; But you said to your
servants, &lsquo;Unless your youngest brother comes down with you,
you shall not see my face again.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah carefully repeated the story,
showing he had listened and understood.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He continued:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;When we went back to your
servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. And our father
said, &lsquo;Go again, buy us a little food.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But we said, &lsquo;We cannot go
down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down, for
we cannot see the man&rsquo;s face unless our youngest brother is
with us.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then your servant my father said to
us, &lsquo;You know that my wife bore me two sons. One went away from
me, and I said, &ldquo;Surely he has been torn to pieces,&rdquo; and
I have never seen him since. If you take this one also from me, and
harm happens to him, you will bring my gray hair down to the grave in
sorrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah laid Jacob&rsquo;s heart bare
before Joseph. He did not know he was speaking of Joseph to Joseph.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He went on, &ldquo;Now therefore,
when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us&mdash;his
life is bound up in the boy&rsquo;s life&mdash;when he sees that the
boy is not with us, he will die. And your servants will bring down
the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">For your servant became surety for
the boy to my father, saying, &lsquo;If I do not bring him back to
you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Now therefore, please let your
servant remain instead of the boy as a slave to my lord, and let the
boy go back with his brothers. For how can I go up to my father if
the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my
father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This was the man who had once said,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sell Joseph.&rdquo; Now he said, &ldquo;Let me be
the slave; let the favored son go free.&rdquo; He offered himself in
Benjamin&rsquo;s place, not to save his own life, but to spare his
father&rsquo;s heart.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah&rsquo;s speech was not
polished rhetoric; it was a confession, a plea, and a sign of true
change. He accepted responsibility, remembered his father&rsquo;s
grief, and chose sacrifice instead of self-preservation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This was the moment I had been
leading them toward through years of famine, fear, and testing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph&rsquo;s next words belong to
the next chapter. But here, in this one, the brothers&rsquo; guilt
had surfaced, their unity had been proved, and Judah had stepped
forward as a willing substitute.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Through this, I was preparing not
only for their reconciliation with Joseph, but for the future: from
Judah&rsquo;s line would come kings, and at last One who would offer
Himself as substitute for many.</P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 45 -  &ldquo;I Am Joseph: The Reveal,
the Tears, and the Road Back Home&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Judah&rsquo;s plea for Benjamin and
for his father broke through Joseph&rsquo;s restraint. The test was
complete.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph could no longer control
himself in front of all those who stood by.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He cried out, &ldquo;Have everyone
leave my presence!&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So no Egyptian stayed with him when
Joseph made himself known to his brothers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He wept so loudly that the Egyptians
heard it, and the news reached Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. Years of loss,
betrayal, loneliness, and longing poured out in those tears. I saw
them all.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;I
am Joseph. Is my father still alive?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His brothers could not answer him.
They were terrified in his presence&mdash;stunned, speechless, unable
to process that the powerful ruler in front of them was the boy they
had sold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Joseph said to his brothers:,
&ldquo;Come near to me, please.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They came near.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said, &ldquo;I am your brother
Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.<BR>But now, do not be distressed or
angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead
of you to preserve life.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">For these two years the famine has
been in the land, and there are five years left in which there will
be neither plowing nor harvest. God sent me before you to preserve
for you a remnant on earth and to keep many survivors alive.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So then, it was not you who sent me
here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all
his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph did not excuse their sin, but
he saw My purpose overruling it. He interpreted his entire suffering
through My hand, not simply their hatred.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He continued:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Hurry and go up to my father
and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me
lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay. You shall live in
the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me&mdash;you and your
children and your children&rsquo;s children, your flocks, your herds,
and all that you have. There I will provide for you, for there are
still five years of famine to come, so that you and your household
and all that you have do not come to poverty.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">And now your eyes see, and the eyes
of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my own mouth that speaks to
you. You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and of all that
you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Joseph threw his arms around
his brother Benjamin and wept. Benjamin wept on his neck.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph kissed all his brothers and
wept upon them. After that, his brothers were able to talk with him.
Fear began to give way to amazement and a fragile joy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">News reached Pharaoh&rsquo;s house:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s brothers have
come.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">This pleased Pharaoh and his
servants. I inclined Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart toward Joseph&rsquo;s
family.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh said to Joseph:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Tell your brothers, &lsquo;Do
this: load your animals and go back to the land of Canaan. Take your
father and your households and come to me. I will give you the best
of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">And you, Joseph, are commanded to
say, &lsquo;Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your
little ones and your wives, bring your father, and come. Do not worry
about your goods, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph&rsquo;s brothers did so.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph gave them wagons according to
Pharaoh&rsquo;s command, provisions for the journey, and each man a
change of clothes. But to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of
silver and five changes of clothes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">To his father he sent, ten donkeys
loaded with the best things of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded
with grain, bread, and provisions for the journey. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He sent his brothers away, and as
they departed he said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Do not quarrel on the way.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He knew their tendency to blame and
argue. I was not only restoring them to Joseph and to Jacob, but also
reshaping how they lived with one another.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They went up from Egypt and came to
Jacob their father in the land of Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They told him, &ldquo;Joseph is
still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob&rsquo;s heart went numb; he
did not believe them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But when they told him all the words
of Joseph, which he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons
that Joseph had sent to carry him, his spirit revived.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel said, &ldquo;It is enough.
Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The son he thought dead was alive.
The story he believed for decades was overturned in a moment. I had
taken what his other sons meant for evil and turned it into a means
of survival and reunion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph&rsquo;s suffering was not
wasted. His brothers&rsquo; repentance was real. Jacob&rsquo;s grief
was not My final word.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Soon, the whole family would go down
to Egypt, where I would make them into a great nation&mdash;just as I
had promised Abraham.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 46 -  &ldquo;Do Not Be Afraid to Go
Down: The Family Becomes a Nation&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel (Jacob) set out with all he
had. The wagons Joseph sent, the donkeys loaded with Egypt&rsquo;s
best goods, the hope that Joseph was alive&mdash;all of it moved him
southward.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He came to Beersheba, the place
where Abraham and Isaac had called on My name. There he offered
sacrifices to Me, the God of his father Isaac.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">In the night, I spoke to him in
visions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Jacob,
Jacob.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He answered, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;I am
God, the God of your father.<BR>Do not be afraid to go down to
Egypt,<BR>for there I will make you into a great nation.<BR>I myself
will go down with you to Egypt,<BR>and I will surely bring you up
again.<BR>And Joseph&rsquo;s own hand will close your eyes.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob feared what Egypt might
mean&mdash;distance from the land of promise, memories of Abraham&rsquo;s
and Isaac&rsquo;s own troubles there, the weight of old age. I met
him in that fear and tied My promises to his journey. My covenant was
not cancelled by the move; I would use it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob arose from Beersheba, and
the sons of Israel carried their father, their little ones, and their
wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent. They took their livestock and
their possessions they had gained in Canaan and went into Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob and all his offspring with
him:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">his sons and his sons&rsquo; sons, 
</P>
<P>his daughters and his sons&rsquo; daughters&mdash;<BR>all his
descendants he brought with him into Egypt. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I recorded those who went down with
him, the roots of the nation that would later come up out of that
land:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Leah came:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reuben (Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn) 
	and Reuben&rsquo;s sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simeon and his sons: Jemuel,
	Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul (born to a Canaanite woman). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Levi and his sons: Gershon,
	Kohath, and Merari. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Judah and his sons: Er, Onan,
	Shelah, Perez, and Zerah&mdash;but Er and Onan had died in Canaan.
	Perez&rsquo;s sons: Hezron and Hamul. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Issachar and his sons: Tola, Puah,
	Yob, and Shimron. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zebulun and his sons: Sered, Elon,
	and Jahleel. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These sons and grandsons of Leah,
including daughters who went with Jacob, were thirty-three persons.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Zilpah (Leah&rsquo;s servant,
whom I had given to Leah) came: Gad and his sons: Zephon, Haggi,
Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. Asher and his sons: Imnah,
Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah&rsquo;s
sons: Heber and Malchiel. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The descendants of Zilpah who went
with Jacob numbered sixteen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Rachel, Jacob&rsquo;s beloved,
came: Joseph and Benjamin. Joseph was already in Egypt. To Joseph,
before Jacob arrived, I had given two sons in Egypt through Asenath
daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Benjamin came Bela, Becher,
Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The descendants of Rachel (excluding
Jacob himself) were fourteen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">From Bilhah (Rachel&rsquo;s servant,
whom I had given to Rachel) came: Dan and his son: Hushim. Naphtali
and his sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The descendants of Bilhah were
seven.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">All the persons belonging to Jacob
who came into Egypt&mdash;his own direct descendants, not counting
the wives of his sons&mdash;were sixty-six. Including Joseph and his
two sons already in Egypt, the whole household of Jacob numbered
seventy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I counted them because I would
multiply them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob sent Judah ahead to Joseph, to
lead the way to Goshen. Judah, who had once led the way into
betrayal, now led the way into reunion and preservation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph prepared his chariot and went
up to meet his father Israel in Goshen. When he appeared before him,
he fell on his neck and wept a long time.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;Now
let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still
alive.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">The son he had mourned for decades
stood living before him. The weight of grief lifted; the desire of
his heart was satisfied.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Joseph said to his brothers and
his father&rsquo;s household:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I will go up and tell
Pharaoh, and will say to him, &lsquo;My brothers and my father&rsquo;s
household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. The men
are shepherds; they have been keepers of livestock, and they have
brought their flocks and their herds and all that they possess.&rsquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Pharaoh calls you and says,
&lsquo;What is your occupation?&rsquo; you shall say, &lsquo;Your
servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until
now, both we and our fathers,&rsquo; so that you may dwell in the
land of Goshen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">For every shepherd is detestable to
the Egyptians.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph used Egypt&rsquo;s prejudice
to secure a separate place for his family&mdash;a space in Goshen
where they could grow into a distinct people, not swallowed up by
Egyptian life and worship. Under My hand, even cultural disdain
became a tool for preserving the covenant line.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob had gone down in fear and old
age. I went with him. In Goshen, his family would become a nation,
and in due time I would bring them up again, just as I had said.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I am the God who counts the seventy
going down and the multitude coming up.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 47 -  &ldquo;Goshen, the Famine
Policy, and the Old Man Before a King&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph went in and told Pharaoh:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;My father and my brothers,
with their flocks and herds and all that they have, have come from
the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He chose five of his brothers and
presented them before Pharaoh.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh asked, &ldquo;What is your
occupation?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered, &ldquo;Your servants
are shepherds, as our fathers were. We have come to stay in the land
for a while, because the famine is severe in Canaan, and your
servants&rsquo; flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your
servants dwell in the land of Goshen.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;Your
father and your brothers have come to you. The land of Egypt is
before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the
land. Let them live in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any
capable men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I had moved Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart to
favor Joseph; now that favor extended to Joseph&rsquo;s whole family.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph then brought in his father
Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Pharaoh asked, &ldquo;How many are
the years of your life?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob answered, &ldquo;The years of
my sojourning are one hundred and thirty. Few and difficult have been
the years of my life, and they have not attained to the years of the
lives of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He saw his life as a
pilgrimage&mdash;marked by trouble, yet lived under My hand.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob blessed Pharaoh again and went
out from his presence.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph settled his father and his
brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best
part of the land&mdash;in the region of Rameses&mdash;as Pharaoh had
commanded. Joseph provided food for his father, his brothers, and all
his father&rsquo;s household, according to the number of their
dependents.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Meanwhile, the famine weighed
heavily on Egypt and Canaan. There was no food in many places; the
people grew weak with hunger.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph collected all the money that
was found in Egypt and Canaan in exchange for grain, and he brought
the money into Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. When the money in Egypt and
Canaan was spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Give us food. Why should we
die in your presence? Our money is gone.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph said, &ldquo;Give me your
livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock,
if your money is gone.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So they brought their livestock to
Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for horses, flocks of
sheep, herds of cattle, and donkeys. That year he sustained them with
food in return for all their livestock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When that year ended, they came to
him the next year and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;We will not hide from my lord
that our money is all spent and the herds of livestock are my lord&rsquo;s.
There is nothing left before my lord but our bodies and our land. Why
should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our
land for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give
us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not
become desolate.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Joseph bought all the land of
Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine
was severe, and the land became Pharaoh&rsquo;s. As for the people,
he moved them into the cities from one end of Egypt to the other.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Only the land of the priests he did
not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived
on that; therefore they did not sell their land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph said to the people:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Today I have bought you and
your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you so you may sow the land.
At the harvest, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths
shall be your own&mdash;for seed for the field and for food for you,
your households, and your little ones.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They answered, &ldquo;You have saved
our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be
servants to Pharaoh.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Joseph established this as a
statute in the land of Egypt: that Pharaoh should have a fifth. It
remained in place long after Joseph&rsquo;s time. Only the land of
the priests did not become Pharaoh&rsquo;s.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Under My providence, Joseph
centralized Egypt&rsquo;s wealth under Pharaoh and at the same time
preserved the lives of the people. Judgment through famine and mercy
through wise administration met together.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel (Jacob) and his family
settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired
property there, were fruitful, and multiplied greatly. The family I
had counted as seventy began to grow into a nation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years. Thus the years of his life were one hundred and
forty-seven.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the time drew near for Israel
to die, he called his son Joseph and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If now I have found favor in
your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and promise to deal with me
in steadfast love and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, but let
me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their
burial place.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He wanted his body to rest in the
land I had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and to him&mdash;not in the
land where his family was temporarily sheltered.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph answered:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I will do as you have said.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Swear to me.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Joseph swore to him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Israel bowed himself on the
head of his bed, leaning into the promise that, though he died in
Egypt, I would bring him&mdash;and his descendants&mdash;back to the
land I had sworn to give them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They were safe in Egypt for now, but
Egypt was not their home. My plan stretched beyond famine relief and
good pasture, toward a future exodus and a nation that would bear My
name.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><STRONG>Genesis 48 -  &ldquo;Crossed Hands and the
Blessing of the Future&rdquo;</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Some time after Jacob had settled in
Egypt, word came to Joseph: &ldquo;Your father is ill.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph took with him his two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to his father. The boy whom his
brothers sold was now bringing his own sons to the man who had once
mourned him as dead.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Jacob heard that Joseph was
coming, he summoned his strength and sat up on the bed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to Joseph, &ldquo;God
Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
and said to me, &lsquo;Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply
you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and will give this
land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He anchored his words in My
promise&mdash;fruitfulness and land.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Jacob did something more than a
simple grandfatherly blessing; he made a legal, covenantal move:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Now your two sons, who were
born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you here&mdash;Ephraim
and Manasseh&mdash;shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. The
children you beget after them shall be yours; they shall be called by
the name of their brothers in their inheritance.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I led him to adopt these two
grandsons as if they were his own sons. Through this, Joseph would
receive a double portion among the tribes of Israel. Ephraim and
Manasseh would stand beside the other sons as founding tribes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob briefly remembered sorrow:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;When I came from Paddan,
Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there
was still some distance to go to Ephrath. I buried her there on the
way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His love for Rachel still lived near
the surface, even as he prepared to bless Rachel&rsquo;s grandsons.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Israel saw Joseph&rsquo;s sons,
he asked:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Who are these?&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph answered, &ldquo;They are my
sons, whom God has given me here.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob&rsquo;s eyes were dim with
age; he could not see clearly. Joseph brought his sons near, and
Jacob kissed them and embraced them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He said to Joseph. &ldquo;I had not
thought to see your face&mdash;and now God has let me see your
offspring also.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He acknowledged My kindness in
restoring more than he had dared hope for.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph then positioned the boys
carefully. He took Ephraim, the younger, in his right hand toward
Jacob&rsquo;s left, and Manasseh, the firstborn, in his left hand
toward Jacob&rsquo;s right. Joseph assumed the right hand&mdash;the
hand of greater honor&mdash;would rest on Manasseh.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But I guided Jacob differently.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Israel stretched out his hands and
deliberately crossed them: his right hand on the head of Ephraim, the
younger, and his left hand on Manasseh, the firstborn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then he blessed Joseph (through the
boys) and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;The God before whom my
fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,<BR>the God who has been my shepherd
all my life long to this day,<BR>the Angel who has redeemed me from
all evil,<BR>bless the boys.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Let my name be carried on in
them,<BR>and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,<BR>and let
them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He confessed Me as his lifelong
Shepherd and Redeemer and asked that Abraham&rsquo;s and Isaac&rsquo;s
covenant identity rest on these Egyptian-born sons.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph saw that his father&rsquo;s
right hand was on the head of Ephraim, and it displeased him. This
looked like a mistake, a confusion of old age.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He took hold of his father&rsquo;s
hand to move it from Ephraim&rsquo;s head to Manasseh&rsquo;s head:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;No, my father, this one is
the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">But Jacob refused.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I know, my son, I know.<BR>He
also shall become a people, and he also shall be great.<BR>Nevertheless,
his younger brother shall be greater than he,<BR>and his offspring
shall become a multitude of nations.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">I was again choosing the younger
over the older, as I had done with Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over
Esau, and as I would continue to do in many ways. Human custom said
&ldquo;firstborn&rdquo;; My purpose said &ldquo;Ephraim.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So Jacob blessed them that day and
said, &ldquo;By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, &lsquo;God
make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;Behold,
I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again
to the land of your fathers. And I have given to you one portion more
than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorites with
my sword and my bow.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He looked beyond Egypt. I would be
with Joseph&rsquo;s line and would one day bring them back to Canaan.
The &ldquo;one portion more&rdquo; pointed to the extra inheritance
Joseph received through Ephraim and Manasseh&mdash;and to a specific
tract of land his descendants would later hold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob&rsquo;s body was failing, but
My promises through him were still unfolding. In that small bedroom
in Egypt, with an old man&rsquo;s hands crossed over two boys&rsquo;
heads, I was shaping the future tribes of Israel and affirming again:
I choose whom I will, and My covenant continues from generation to
generation.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob knew his time was very near.
He called his sons and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Gather yourselves together,
that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.
Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob; listen to Israel your father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">These were not casual blessings.
Through an old man&rsquo;s words, I was sketching the future shape of
the tribes and hinting at My long-range plan.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Reuben, you are my

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Jacob (Israel) had just breathed his
last.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph fell on his father&rsquo;s
face, wept over him, and kissed him. The son who had been lost and
found now held his father in death.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph ordered the physicians in his
service to embalm Israel. So they embalmed him. It took forty days,
the full time needed for embalming, and the Egyptians wept for him
seventy days. I gave Joseph such favor that a foreign nation mourned
a shepherd from Canaan like royalty.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the days of weeping were over,
Joseph spoke to Pharaoh&rsquo;s household:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;If I have found favor in your
eyes, speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying, &lsquo;My father made
me swear, saying, &ldquo;Behold, I am about to die; in my grave that
I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.&rdquo;
Now therefore, let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

Joseph, his brothers, and his father&rsquo;s household.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Only their little ones, flocks, and

funeral.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They came to the threshing floor of
Atad, beyond the Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very
solemn lamentation. Joseph observed seven days of mourning for his
father.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When the Canaanites saw what was
happening, they said:</P>

Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah were there. Jacob&rsquo;s bones rested

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers saw

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;It may be that Joseph will
hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They sent a message to Joseph:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Your father commanded before
he died, &lsquo;Say to Joseph, &ldquo;Please forgive the
transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil
to you.&rdquo;&rsquo; And now, please forgive the transgression of
the servants of the God of your father.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">When Joseph heard this, he wept.
Their fear showed they still did not fully trust his heart&mdash;or
Mine.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His brothers also came and fell down
before him and said:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Behold, we are your
servants.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph said to them:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;Do not be afraid, for am I in
the place of God?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As for you, you meant evil against

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">So do not be afraid;<BR>I will
provide for you and your little ones.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He spoke kindly to them and
comforted them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">They had acted with real malice; I
had worked with real purpose. Their intent and Mine ran in opposite
directions, yet I turned their sin into a means of salvation for
many. Joseph understood this and released vengeance into My hands.</P>
<HR>
<H3 CLASS="western">Joseph&rsquo;s Death and the Next Promise</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his
father&rsquo;s household. He lived 110 years. He saw Ephraim&rsquo;s
children to the third generation; the children of Machir son of
Manasseh were counted as his own. I gave him a long life and a
growing legacy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">As his end approached, Joseph spoke
to his brothers (and their children after them):</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;I am about to die, but God
will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land
that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">He knew Egypt was not the final
stop. My promises were anchored in Canaan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Joseph made the sons of Israel
swear:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">&ldquo;God will surely visit you,
and you shall carry up my bones from here.&rdquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Even in death he tied his future to
the land I had promised, confident I would come for his people.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">Then Joseph died, being 110 years
old. They embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">His coffin waited&mdash;not as a
forgotten relic, but as a quiet witness. When I later brought Israel
out with a mighty hand, they would carry Joseph&rsquo;s bones with
them. The story that began with one family in Canaan and passed
through pits, prisons, and palaces in Egypt would move on toward
exodus, covenant, and a nation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.15in">What his brothers meant for evil, I
meant for good&mdash;and that truth would stand at the center of
Israel&rsquo;s memory of Joseph, and of how I work through even the
darkest events.</P>
